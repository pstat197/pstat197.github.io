We have a class [GitHub organization](https://github.com/pstat197) for the data science capstone. Enrolled students should request an email invitation from course staff if they have not received one.

Students have write access to all repositories within the organization and the ability to create their own public or private repositories.

Although the organization is invite-only, it is not private:

-   repositories for course modules are public, and anyone on the web can access them;

-   private repositories remain visible to course staff.

Students are asked to submit work by contributing to repositories for course modules. Any such contributions would remain publicly visible. Students can elect to keep their work on a private fork if they prefer.
