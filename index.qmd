Welcome to the homepage for UC Santa Barbara's year-long data science capstone sequence!

Our program aims to provide students with hands-on research training and career development opportunities related to data science. By design, the program is equally suitable for students interested in entering the job market as it is for those considering graduate school: we partner with both industry and academic project sponsors to offer research experiences spanning a breadth of application domains.

The capstone sequence comprises two distinct portions: a preparatory course in data science topics and collaborative research skills (PSTAT197A, offered fall term) and two experiential learning courses in which students work in teams on interdisciplinary projects sponsored by an external partner (PSTAT197B-C, offered winter and spring terms).

Here you will find program information for prospective students and project sponsors along with course information for current students and summaries of past projects.
