## Today

-   finish discussing results from last time

-   setup for first group assignment due next Friday

    -   assignment objectives and instructions

    -   review repository

-   workshop ideas and plan tasks in groups

## Assignment objective

***Your task:*** prepare and present a descriptive analysis of the survey responses addressing 2-3 questions or goals of your choosing.

-   questions or goals should be of moderate complexity; easy to state and understand but should require a little work to answer

    -   too simple: *what proportion of students have research experience?*

    -   better: *are students with research experience more confident/comfortable with technical skills than students without, considering coursework history?*

## Outcomes

The learning outcomes for this assignment are less focused on methodology:

-   formulate questions and plan a simple analysis

-   practice using a GitHub repo in a team project setting

-   prepare a report

-   learn one or more new-to-you data manipulation techniques

## Assignment set-up

1.  accept GH classroom assignment [here](https://classroom.github.com/a/d-4iOFtd); this will create/add your team repo
2.  clone repo to local
3.  review repo contents:
    -   `data` with survey responses and metadata

    -   `scripts` with preprocessing and in-class analysis

    -   `results` with report template for preparing write-up

    -   `README.md` with assignment instructions

## Deliverable

Your 'submission' will be in the form of commits to the group repository, in particular:

-   an updated `results/report.qmd` file containing your write-up source

-   a rendered `results/report.html` file

. . .

Please make final commits by ***Friday, October 14, 11:59pm PST.***

. . .

Recall there is a 24-hour grace period; any commits submitted after Saturday 11:59pm may not receive review.

## Resources

-   lab 2 and in-class analysis `scripts/week2-surveys.R`

-   slack and course staff OH

-   [MDSR ch. 4](https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr2e/ch-dataI.html) on data wrangling

-   [RStudio cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) and [tidyverse documentation](https://www.tidyverse.org/), esp. dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2

## Workshopping today

Try to accomplish three goals:

1.  pool ideas for questions or themes to explore in the data
2.  pair up, divide work, and assign tasks
3.  agree on a communication plan for finishing work
    -   slack groupchat or similar

    -   meeting outside of class sometime next week
