# On data science

## Google trends: data science

```{r}
#| fig-align: left

library(tidyverse)
read_csv('data/ds-googletrends.csv', 
         skip = 2, 
         col_types = cols(
           col_datetime(format = '%Y-%m'), 
           col_double()),
         col_names = c('date', 'interest')
         ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = interest)) +
  geom_line()
```

-   Data science emerged as a term of art in the last decade

-   Interest exploded in the last five years

## Origins: 'data analysis'

Tukey advocated for 'data analysis' as a broader field than statistics [@tukey1962future], including:

-   statistical theory and methodology;

-   visualization and data display techniques;

-   computation and scalability;

-   breadth of application.

. . .

Look famililar? Tukey's 'data analysis' is proto-modern data science.

## A bit of history

It's worth noting that in the first half of the 20th century, much of statistics focused on methodology and theory for the analysis of small *iid* samples, and in particular:

-   inference on means and inference on tables;

-   analysis of variance;

-   tests of distribution.

. . .

The inferential framework brought to bear on these 'simpler' problems largely carried over when the field began to specialize.

## Contrasting approaches

From 1960-2010, adopters of the 'data analysis as a field' view were largely industry practitioners and applied statisticians who advocated for training and practice that included empirical methods and computation in addition to statistical inference [@donoho201750].

. . .

Their ideas evolved into an alternative approach to working with data:

-   data-driven rather than theory-driven;

-   iterative rather than conclusive.

## Confirmatory approach

The "confirmatory" approach of the classical inferential framework.

```{dot}
digraph confirm {
  
  layout = dot
  rankdir = LR
  fontname = "sans-serif"
  fontsize = "20pt"
  
  node [
      shape = rectangle,
      fontsize = "20pt",
      fontname = "sans-serif"
      ]

  sci [
    label = "domain \lknowledge", 
    shape = ellipse
    ]
  
  subgraph cluster_1{
    color = white
    
    hyp [label = "hypotheses"]
    exp [label = "designed \lexperiment"]
    
    label = "data generation"
  }
  
  subgraph cluster_2 {
    color = white
    
    mdl [label = "statistical \lmodel"]
    dat [label = "data"]
    
    label = "data analysis"
  }
  
  subgraph cluster_3 {
    color = white
    node [shape = ellipse]
    
    yay [label = "supporting \levidence"]
    nay [label = "opposing \levidence"]
    
    label = "decision"
  }
  sci -> hyp
  hyp -> exp
  exp -> dat
  exp -> mdl
  dat -> yay
  dat -> nay
  mdl -> yay
  mdl -> nay

}
```

-   output is a decision

-   statistical model determined by experimental design

-   analysis based on statistical theory

## Exploratory approach

The "exploratory" approach of the iterative modern data analysis.

```{dot}
digraph explore {
  layout = dot
  rankdir = LR
  fontname = "sans-serif"
  fontsize = "20pt"
  
  node [
      shape = rectangle,
      fontsize = "20pt",
      fontname = "sans-serif"
      ]
      
  sci [
    label = "domain \lknowledge",
    shape = ellipse
    ]
  
  subgraph cluster_1 {
    color = white
    label = "data analysis"
    
    q [label = "question \lformulation"]
    dat [label = "data"]
    mdl [label = "statistical \lmodel"]
    
    q -> dat
    dat -> mdl
    mdl -> q
    
  }
  
  subgraph cluster_2 {
    label = "findings"
    color = white
    
    node [shape = ellipse]
    edge [style = invis]
    
    f1 [label = "finding 1"]
    f2 [label = "finding 2"]
    dots [label = "&#8942;", color = white]
    
  }
    
    sci -> q
    mdl -> {f1 f2}
}

```

-   outputs are findings

-   statistical model determined by data

-   analysis techniques include empirical methods

## Drivers of change

In the 2000s and especially after 2010, the iterative approach enjoys broader applicability than it used to:

-   due to automated and/or scalable data collection

    -   observational data is widely available across domains

    -   and includes large numbers of variables

-   highly specialized data problems evade methodology with theoretical support

-   more accessible to analysts without advanced statistical training

## Machine learning

Machine learning was largely advanced by computer scientists through 2010 and later, most notably:

-   neural networks and deep learning

-   optimization

-   algorithmic analysis

. . .

This was, of course, hugely important in setting the stage for modern predictive modeling, and engaging with these tools required going beyond statistics.

## In sum

-   Around mid-century, it was proposed that specialists should be trained in computational as well as statistical methods

-   Over time practitioners developed an iterative process for data-driven problem solving that was more flexible than the classical inferential framework

-   Computer scientists advanced the field of machine learning substantially

-   Iterative problem solving together with applied machine learning was well-suited to meet the demands of modern data, but the area was largely non-academic

-   Hence, 'data science'

# On research

## What is research?

Research is *systematic investigation* undertaken in order to establish or discover facts.

. . .

What are facts in data science?

-   method *M* outperforms method *M'* at task *T*

-   we analyzed data *D* and reached the conclusion that...

## The research landscape

Formal communities -- *i.e.,* journals, departments, conferences -- have not coalesced around data science research to date.

. . .

Relevant research largely occurs in statistics, computer science, and application domains, and can be divided broadly into:

-   methodology -- creating new techniques to analyze data

-   applications -- applying existing methods to generate new findings

## Methodological research

Methodological research might involve:

-   designing a faster algorithm for solving a particular problem

-   proposing a new technique for analyzing a particular type of data

-   generalizing a technique to a broader range of problems

## Applied research

Applied research might involve:

-   analyzing a specific dataset or producing a novel analysis of existing data

-   creating ad-hoc methods for a domain-specific problem

-   importing methodology from another area to bear on a domain-specific problem

## Data science capstones

Most of the time, our data science capstones fall pretty squarely in the applied domain:

-   sponsor provides data and high-level goals

-   student team works on producing an analysis or analyses

-   mentor advises on methodology

## Relevant skills

There are a few avenues to prepare for this sort of work.

. . .

We'll focus on:

-   recognizing problem patterns

-   developing a functional view of methodology

-   collaborating efficiently

-   independent learning strategies

-   engaging with literature constructively

. . .

It won't provide you with exhaustive methodological preparation, but should support you in learning 'on the job'.

# Design thinking

## Reading responses

Questions to review:

1.  What is meant by a 'systems approach' to data science?
2.  What is meant by 'design thinking' in data science?
3.  (Why) Are these useful concepts?

## Prescriptive *and* descriptive

The Perspective on Data Science paper [@peng2022perspective] is not just descriptive, but also prescriptive: it provides a useful framework for engaging in (applied) research.

-   data scientists trade in data analyses

-   a data analysis is a designed product

-   thinking about design principles can help make a better product

. . .

Let's look at some design principles from [@mcgowan2021design].

## Design principles: matchedness

## Design principles: exhuastiveness
