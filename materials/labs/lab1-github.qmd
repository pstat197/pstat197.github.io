## What's GitHub?

### Git and GitHub

At some point in time -- possibly just a moment ago -- you had to install Git on your local machine, as well as create a GitHub account. So, Git and GitHub are two different things.

**Git is version control software** that enables you to systematically track and control file changes within a *repository* -- a collection of files possibly with some directory structure. (A repository is simply a storage place.)

**GitHub is an online platform** for hosting repositories remotely. Anyone with access to a repository can make changes to files in the repository, and this enables multiple people to collaborate on code.

### local \<\> remote

Usually remote repositories are not updated directly because contributors need to execute codes to test their changes and the remote server that hosts the repository is not equipped to do this.

So, making changes to a repository typically involves communicating information between *local* and *remote* locations. If I want to alter a file and make those changes available to anyone else accessing my repository, most of the time I need to:

-   create/update local copies of repository files, say, on my laptop;

-   make the desired change(s) locally;

-   send the changes back to the remote repository;

-   update the remote repository by accepting changes.

These steps correspond to a sequence of **Git actions**: actions that modify the repository files and/or metadata. The most basic sequence is:

-   `git pull` update the local repository (technically, fetch changes + merge changes from the remote repository);

-   `git add` stage file changes to be committed to the local repository;

-   `git commit` commit staged changes to the local repository;

-   `git push` send committed changes back to the remote repository.

Sometimes contributors take different or additional actions; the complexity of the Git actions required to make a change depends largely on repository settings, permissions, and agreements among collaborators about how workflow should be structured.

### Why are we using GitHub repositories?

Maintaining communication between local and remote copies of a set of files might seem overly complicated, but version control has many benefits, including the ability to track changes and contributions precisely, work in parallel with other contributors, revert to prior versions of files, keep track of issues, quickly share and disseminate work, and solicit user contributions from the coding public. Arguably, for all of these reasons and because of its widespread use, Git/GitHub is a must for data scientists.

In this class you'll learn and practice some basics that will allow you to easily access course files, collaborate with each other, and efficiently submit your coursework. This should equip you to utilize a repository for efficient collaboration with your peers on your capstone project.

## Creating a clone

In Git lingo, a *clone* is a local copy of a remote repository. Creating a clone copies files and establishes the link between local and remote repositories so that changes can be sent to and received from the remote repository. ***You only need to create a clone once.***

To clone a repository, all one needs is:

-   the remote location URL;

-   the local destination where the clone will be created;

-   permission from the repository owner, if private.

I've created a 'sandbox' repository (for playing in) at <https://github.com/pstat197/sandbox>. It's a public repository, so no special permissions are needed. Follow the link to see the repository contents in your browser.

::: callout-important
## Action

**Clone the sandbox repository:**

1.  Open your GitHub client (GitKracken or GitHub Desktop or similar) and ensure you are logged in to your GitHub account.
2.  Look for a 'Clone Repo' menu item or similar and simply input the URL and the place you'd like to clone it; proceed through any prompts.
3.  Check your file navigator to confirm that the repository files were copied.
:::

An alternative possibility is to create the clone using a terminal command. In the terminal, navigate to the desired destination, and input:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/pstat197/sandbox
```

::: callout-note
## Remarks

**On terminal commands:**

-   It's recommended to manage Git actions through a visual client, as it's much easier to see and understand what's happening.

-   However, if you know exactly what you're doing, executing simple actions via Git bash in the terminal can be more efficient at times.

-   For example, you can keep a terminal open in RStudio and manage your repository workflow from there, without having to toggle between environments.

-   Try experimenting with terminal commands from RStudio after you have a little experience with basic Git actions.

## Pre-lab checklist

Have you completed all of the pre-lab activity action items?

1.  Install software: R, RStudio, Git, and a GitHub client
2.  Create a GitHub account and join the [course GitHub org](https://github.com/pstat197/)
3.  Clone the sandbox repo <https://github.com/pstat197/sandbox>

# Lab activity

Open your GitHub client and RStudio. In RStudio, open the project associated with your clone of the sandbox repo.

<!--# TA ACTION: create a markdown file just a few minutes before the lab will begin named after your lab section in a lab-specific directory e.g. '2pm-lab/about-us.md' with some small remark; try to come up with something fun/topical. push the file to the main branch -->

## Basic Git actions

Here you'll make a local change and then push that change to the remote repository.

### Pull

As discussed in the pre-lab activity, the first step to making a change is beginning with the most up-to-date version of the repository files. Your TA will have made a small change to the repository since you first cloned it, so we'll start with retrieving that change.

::: callout-important
## Action

**Pull changes from the remote repository:**

-   In your GitHub client, open the sandbox repository and then look for a 'Pull' menu item.

-   In the terminal: navigate to the root directory of the repository and `git pull`

Technically, `git pull` = `git fetch` + `git merge`. If you ever wish to examine changes without modifying local files, you can `git fetch`.
:::

Examine the updated local repository files; notice that there is now a folder named after your lab section containing a markdown file. Open it up and have a look.

### Make changes

Now that you have the most up-to-date version of all files, create a new markdown file in your lab section folder with a fun fact about you (or anything else if you'd rather) that you'll upload to the repository.

::: callout-important
## Action

**Create a markdown file:**

1.  In RStudio, select File \> New File \> Markdown File
2.  Add an 'About Me' or similar header (use one or more hashes `#` before the header text)
3.  Write a fun fact about yourself
4.  Save the file in your lab folder as `YOURGITHUBUSERNAME-about.md`
:::

### Stage and commit changes

Now that your new file is ready to go you can stage the changes to be committed to the repository and create a commit.

A *commit* is a bundle of changes that will be submitted to the repository along with a message briefly explaining the changes made. Your GitHub client will often fill in a default message such as 'update FILENAME.EXT'.

::: callout-important
## Action

**Stage and commit:**

-   In your client, look for a menu item to add or stage changes. By default any changes made to any file will be included.

    -   Or in the terminal: `git add FILENAME`

-   Once you have staged changes, look for a menu item to commit changes. Add a message and commit the changes.

    -   Or in the terminal: `git add -m "your message here"`
:::

Often these actions are performed together. However, in some workflows it may make sense to stage changes incrementally and create commits that bundle several changes at once. For example, if you need to make an update that requires modifying files A, B, and C, it may make sense to edit and stage changes to A first, followed by B, followed by C, and create the commit only once the full update has been implemented.

### Push

The last step is to push your commit to the remote repository. However, as you will see in a moment, too many people trying to push changes at once can create some problems.

Your TA will instruct someone in your class to push their changes. The very first person to do this will have no problems, since their local repository is up to date with the remote.

Your TA will then instruct someone else to try. But since the first person modified the remote repository, the next person to push changes will no longer be up to date. Git will detect this and the push won't go through. The person must update their local repository first, preferably by `git pull`.

Under the hood, the update action will merge the first person's commit with the second person's local repository. Git is fairly good at doing this in such a way that changes don't get lost or overwritten, but there are some conflicts that it can't resolve automatically. That will happen if multiple changes are made to the same line of the same file.

In this activity everyone is working on independent files and there's no overlap between changes, so although it would be a bit messy to have everyone pull/push sequentially, in principle it could be done. However, there is a more efficient way to work in parallel: by creating *branches*.

## Branching

Inspect your GitHub client closely, and note that you are currently on the 'main' branch of the repository. Think of this as the primary version of the repository. Branches allow contributors to create parallel versions of the repository that they can modify for development purposes while leaving the primary version unaffected.

### Create a branch

Here you'll use branches to avoid stepping on each others' toes while pushing your commits. The strategy will be to create a personal branch, push your commit to that branch, and then merge the branch back into the main branch of the repository.

::: callout-important
## Action

**Create a branch and push your previous commit:**

1.  In your GitHub client, look for a menu item to create and switch to a new branch.
2.  Name your branch your GitHub username.
3.  Check to see that you are currently on your personal branch.
4.  Push your previous commit. You shouldn't have to repeat any of the previous steps, but you can if need be.
:::

### Access your neighbor's branch

While often the main purpose of branching is to create a version of the repository that only you will modify, contributors can inspect any branch of the repository. This can be useful for sharing ideas or getting input or help.

::: callout-important
## Action

**Make a commit to your neighbor's branch**

1.  Find out your neighbor's username and switch to their branch in your GitHub client.
2.  In RStudio, verify that you are on their branch by executing `git status` in the terminal.
3.  Open their markdown file, ask them a simple question about themselves (nothing too personal, please), and add the information to their markdown file.
4.  Stage, commit, and push the change.
5.  When your neighbor has done the same with you, switch back to your own branch in your GitHub client and pull changes.
:::

## Pull requests

Once you are ready to integrate changes you've developed on a branch you can open a *pull request* to merge the development branch with the main branch. (Technically, pull requests can be opened between any two branches.)

'Pull request' is a bit of an odd term; think of it as you making a *request* that your collaborators *pull* your changes for review.

::: callout-important
## Action

**Open a pull request:**

-   In your GitHub client, find a menu item for opening a pull request.

-   Specify the pull request from your branch to the main branch and submit.
:::

Once a pull request is opened, usually a collaborator with maintain privileges must be the one to merge changes and close the request. However, the rules for this depend on repository settings. For this repository, all contributors can merge and close pull requests.

::: callout-important
## Action

Open the repository <https://github.com/pstat197/sandbox> in the browser. Navigate to pull requests.

Find your neighbor's pull request; merge their changes and close the request. Then delete the branch.
