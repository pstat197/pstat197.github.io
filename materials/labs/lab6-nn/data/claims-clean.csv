vacate judgment for fraud on the court filed by plaintiff theodore elaster a minor through his mother and next friend april elaster plaintiff plaintiff asks the court to set aside the courts judgment in favor of defendants hamilton county department of education edward rowe rowe and carol thomas collectively defendants pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure d plaintiff alleges that defendants counsel as an officer of the court committed a fraud upon the court when he and the defendants engaged in a plan to mislead the court causing it to grant defendants motion for summary judgment doc defendants filed a response in opposition doc plaintiff filed a reply doc and supplemental evidence doc which purportedly is the post summary judgment statement recorded and written of witness trevon horne trevon in which trevon essentially denies ever saying or seeing plaintiff trip or kick rowe for the following reasons plaintiffs motion is denied on september the court granted defendants summary judgment motion on all of plaintiffs federal law claims and remanded plaintiffs state law claims back to the circuit court of hamilton county tennessee docs plaintiff who was then represented by counsel did not appeal this final judgment of the court after remand the state court granted plaintiffs counsels motion to withdraw and plaintiff proceeded pro se a bench trial was held in state court and the presiding judge entered judgment in favor of defendants on all of the plaintiffs state law claims plaintiff appealed to the tennessee court of appeals which affirmed the judgment of the state court plaintiff filed an application for permission to appeal to the tennessee supreme court which was denied on october a short time later on november plaintiff filed the pending motion the court of appeals summarized the pertinent facts and proceedings as follows elaster v hamilton cty dept of educ no e coar cv wl at tenn ct app july appeal denied oct emphasis added by court of appeals rule d permits a court to set aside a judgment for fraud on the court in extraordinary circumstances fed r civ p d demjanjuk v petrovsky f d th cir fraud upon the court is typically limited to egregious events such as bribery of a judge or juror or improper influence exerted on the court affecting the integrity of the court and its ability to function impartially apotex corp v merck co inc f d fed cir the law regarding claims of fraud under rule is well settled and has been explained by this court as plaintiff contends that d scott bennett as counsel for defendants and an officer of the court falsified evidence of the assault by preparing and submitting a false and misleading affidavit of rowe in conjunction with the summary judgment motion doc at page id the crux of plaintiffs argument is based on plaintiffs claim that rowe intentionally punched him in the face without provocation and has been falsely denying it ever since plaintiffs claim for fraud is a conclusory allegation that defense counsel help perpetuate rowes allegedly false affidavit in conjunction with the summary judgment proceedings in this court first plaintiff has not demonstrated rowe has submitted a false affidavit to the contrary the state court assessed rowes claim of an inadvertent collision as credible after a bench trial that included trevons testimony second none of the exhibits statements declarations or other evidence submitted by plaintiff come close to constituting clear and convincing evidence that defense counsel committed or perpetuated a fraud on the court even applying liberal standards applicable to pro se filings there is no proof defense counsel engaged in conduct directed to the judicial machinery itself that was intentionally false willfully blind to the truth or in reckless disregard for the truth during the summary judgment proceedings see computer leasco inc v ntp inc f appx th cir nor is there any proof defense counsel concealed the truth while under a duty to disclose id plaintiffs claims do not in any way constitute extraordinary circumstances affecting the integrity of the court or its ability to function impartially gen med f appx at massi wl at even if plaintiffs and trevons current account of plaintiffs collision with rowe is credited and even if the current motion is considered timely in spite of the fact that plaintiff contested rowes version of events from the inception the motion would still fail because in granting defendants a summary judgment on plaintiffs federal law claims the court construed the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff doc as a result the court assumed rowe intentionally struck plaintiff and that plaintiffs rights were violated assumptions not borne out at trial in state court even these assumptions however did not prevent summary judgment for the reasons exhaustively explained in the courts september memorandum and order which will not be repeated herein docs for there to have been a fraud upon the court the court must have been deceived and it was not see johnson f d at explaining that fraud on the court only exists if the misconduct deceives the court demjanjuk f d at holding that only actions that actually subvert the judicial process can be the basis for upsetting otherwise settled decrees on the basis of fraud on the court accordingly the motion fails defendants response in opposition requests reimbursement of their attorneys fees and costs incurred in the preparation and submission of their response to the motion defendants did not however support their request with any citation to authority under these circumstances the court declines to award defendants any fees or costs in spite of the baseless nature of the motion for the above reasons plaintiffs

url80,irrelevant,tbw by chris guest rudy gobert of the utah jazz is a transformative world beating defensive talent with two consecutive defensive player of the year awards mitchell robinson of the new york knicks is coming off one of the most impressive rookie campaigns in recent memory as a two way force on a rebuilding team these two might be at different points in their career but there is strong evidence to suggest that robinson is laying the groundwork for a career along the lines of gobert s because the knicks sophomore big man certainly doesn t have the tenure that the jazz star possesses we will mostly be comparing each player s breakout season gobert s second in robinson s first in the reason gobert s rookie season was not included is because he only played minutes across games none of which were starts it wasn t until his second season at age that the frenchman would truly ingratiate himself with head coach quin snyder oct brooklyn ny usa new york knicks center mitchell robinson dunks the basketball against the brooklyn nets during the third quarter at barclays center mandatory credit brad penner usa today sports while both players are widely renowned for their tremendous defensive gifts they carve out interesting niches for themselves on offense as well last season robinson produced some staggering numbers according to basketball reference he put forth an insane offensive rating per possessions while only playing minutes per game in total minutes that makes him one of only players in nba history to play over minutes and finish the season with an orating above those players are steve kerr who did it twice with the bulls tim legler fred hoiberg brandan wright and kevon looney last season robinson is also the youngest player in this category at age that sky high number is even more impressive when you consider new york s putrid offense last season which was th out of teams robinson was mostly relying on lob and putback dunks on offense to score but he was certainly not shy about hunting those shots out as over percent of his attempts came within zero to three feet of the basket in the paint the year old rookie was a master of his domain finishing the season with a striking true shooting percentage of course gobert has a career true shooting percentage of over the course of his seven year career percent of which have come within zero to three feet of the basket per basketball reference however in his breakout campaign gobert s ts was nearly nine percentage points lower than robinson s could the latter actually be slightly ahead of gobert s learning curve so far despite robinson s raw talent in finishing around the basket gobert is the more well rounded offensive player according to bball index s historical player grades database though both players are terrifying pick and roll finishers gobert graded out with an a th percentile in roll gravity during his breakout year while robinson scored an a th percentile among big men nov salt lake city ut usa utah jazz center rudy gobert shoots the ball over brooklyn nets center de andre jordan during the second half at vivint smart home arena mandatory credit russ isabella usa today sports gobert was also a marginally better passer and post player with a c in playmaking th percentile while robinson was a lowly d in the nd percentile gobert s footwork and length in his second season was already well developed and it s continued to get better leading to a b grade nd percentile robinson again lagged behind with a c grade in the th percentile though gobert brought a few more notable skills to the table on offense robinson was actually more careful with the ball than the stifle tower was robinson s percent turnover rate was also percent lower than gobert s percent and gobert s assists paled in comparison to the turnovers he committed robinson also did all of this damage on a slightly lower usage than gobert percent versus lastly according to cleaning the glass gobert s points per shot attempt were impressive in at which was in the th percentile among bigs however robinson blew him out of the water during his rookie campaign with an astounding which was in the th percentile again on a far worse team robinson was actually a small positive last year for the knicks on offense his points per possessions was actually fifth on the team gobert on the other hand was a huge negative on offense during his breakout year as his points per possession would indicate while gobert has curtailed his turnovers in recent years and polished up his capabilities it does seem as if robinson was a superior offensive player in this early juncture of each player s career it must be noted that gobert had a career best year on offense in by leading the nba in field goal percentage effective field goal percentage and logging career highs in points per game assists per game and a career best assist to turnover ratio clearly he s found his niche in a way robinson must continue aspiring to oct new york ny usa atlanta hawks guard de andre bembry has his shot blocked by new york knicks center mitchell robinson during the first half at madison square garden mandatory credit adam hunger usa today sports gobert has won two straight defensive player of the year awards and was the preseason favorite to win a third while some of robinson s earliest summer league and preseason highlights were centered around using his tremendous speed and length to surprise three point shooters blocking their outside shots into the stands robinson produced one of the most staggering defensive rookie campaigns in nba history last season one that seemingly fell under the radar for many fans according to basketball reference robinson became one of only three players in nba history to play more than minutes in a rookie season and produce a defensive box plus minus of better than the other two were mark eaton and manute bol who are no and no all time in nba history in blocks per game respectively digging in deeper robinson produced a stunning block rate of percent during his rookie season which placed him in singularly elite company only three players in nba history have played more than minutes and produced a block rate of percent or higher manute bol who did it a stunning times and alonzo mourning who did it at age with the miami heat robinson s youth sets him apart from the crowd when you expand this list to players that played at least minutes and attained a percent or higher block rate robinson remains the youngest player to achieve the feat at the tender age of the second youngest none other than gobert in our chosen season of the stifle tower was a terrifying defensive presence that year and his defensive points per possessions was in the rd percentile among big men the opposing team s effective field goal percentage fell by percentage points when gobert was on the court their turnover rate rose by percent and their offensive rebound rate fell by percent all showing gobert s all around impact as a rim protector and interior presence on defense nov salt lake city ut usa utah jazz center rudy gobert blocks the shot of brooklyn nets guard kyrie irving during the second half at vivint smart home arena mandatory credit russ isabella usa today sports while gobert piled up almost more total blocks than robinson did most of that can be chalked up to minutes gobert played and robinson only played this brings up perhaps the single biggest advantage that gobert has over robinson fouling robinson was an absolute foul magnet during his first nba season as he piled up a hilarious fouls per minutes according to basketball reference that s per game in minutes despite the fact that robinson played roughly fewer minutes than gobert he committed only fewer fouls which is patently absurd more than anything this shows that robinson is flying all over the place often wildly in order to try and affect each and every shot that s anywhere in his vicinity remember he s only years old so it seems reasonable to expect the talented big man to curtail some of those habits as he continues to get comfortable in the nba gobert to his credit has never had much of an issue with over fouling his career high in fouls per game was during and he only produced a tiny per minutes in his breakout campaign gobert was also superior to robinson in rebounding during the year old gobert finished th in total rebounds and he is th among all active players with career rebounds per game most of which are taken on the defensive end where he employs his length and tremendous defensive smarts to vacuum up boards with ease the lowest gobert has finished in total rebound rate since his breakout season is th during in which he put up a still elite percent total rebound rate though robinson finished with a solid percent total rebound rate he graded out with a d per bball index in defensive rebounding rd percentile perhaps robinson s spindly frame needs to fill out more for him to truly take the requisite punishment in the paint needed for tough boards despite that deficiency robinson does best gobert in bball index s perimeter defense category while gobert is schemed in the jazz s system as a drop back big that rarely leaves the paint robinson was allowed to freelance on the perimeter in his rookie season leading to a shockingly good a grade nd percentile among bigs of course as defensive centers both players are expected to be elite rim protectors and gobert does best robinson in that category gobert s campaign saw him nab a th percentile a grade in interior defense while robinson lagged slightly behind with an rd percentile a grade oct washington dc usa washington wizards guard bradley beal and forward rui hachimura box out new york knicks center mitchell robinson during the first half at capital one arena mandatory credit tommy gilligan usa today sports in the end it seems that robinson is on a similar career path as gobert but it must be noted that the year old frenchman dpoy has continued to work on his game and put forth all star worthy numbers last season one feather in robinson s cap is that he made a huge impact during his first season while also being two years younger than gobert was in if robinson s rookie campaign is any indication he has the defensive mindset and physical profile to project as a switchable big man with terrific scoring chops around the basket all on minuscule usage becoming one of the best rim protectors of all time is not out of the question for robinson albeit still a premature expectation after one season his floor looks to be an elite two way center with preternatural shot blocking instincts and a penchant for finishing around the rim with ease were he to add ranged shooting to his repertoire something gobert has not been able to do yet either robinson truly would become one of the league s most dangerous fives for now both are active short range weapons around the rim on either end teams can only roster so many of those these days but there still is a place for guys like robinson and gobert albeit with the right teammates stretching the floor around them with a percent block rate points per shot attempt per cleaning the glass and a sterling box plus minus robinson s early returns in the season are good but on an absolutely listless knicks squad with seemingly infinite power forwards he is only playing a measly minutes per game expect that number to rise as he attempts to live up to his billing as the next rudy gobert chris guest is a writer for clutch points and fan sided based out of the cursed sports city of atlanta a pokémon master and beer connoisseur chris enjoys bad movies

soon to be famous illinois author contest for his contemporary fantasy novel the journeyman the journeyman is the first book in the commons series it was published in january and is available for sale on amazon the journeyman is recommended for both teens and adults paul reid died in the snow at seventeen the day of his death he told a lie and for the rest of his life he wondered if that was what killed him and so begins the battle for the afterlife known as the commons it s been taken over by a corporate raider who uses the energy of its souls to maintain his brutal control the result is an imaginary landscape of a broken america stuck in time and overrun by the heroes monsters dreams and nightmares of the imprisoned dead three people board a bus to nowhere a new york street kid an iraq war veteran and her five year old special needs son after a horrific accident they are the last best hope for the commons to free itself along for the ride are a shotgun toting goth girl a six foot six mummy a mute shaolin monk with anger management issues and the only guide left to lead them three journeys separate but joined one mission to save forever but first they have to save themselves paul reid died in the snow at seventeen the day of his death he told a lie and for the rest of his life he wondered if that was what killed him don t worry he said to mike hibbets the only adult in new york city who d ever cared about him i m coming back pop mike ran the new beginnings group home where paul lived he didn t believe the lie and paul told himself that it didn t matter does your face hurt the old man leaned on his desk in the new beginnings main office paul twisted his pewter ring a habit that announced when something was bothering him his face did hurt especially his swollen eye as did the ribs he hadn t been able to protect two days earlier when he hit the ground balled up in a hell s kitchen alley while four guys stomped him until they tired of it he d tried to shield his face where damage might show forever but he fared just as poorly at that as the afternoon sun cast a beat down shadow show on a brick wall and a girl stood nearby and cried paul had little to say and no one worked a silence like pop mike his nickname had once been father mike due to a talent for sniffing out guilt that rivaled any priest s he asked the new beginnings kids to drop that name so potential donors wouldn t confuse his shelter with a religious operation there s no god to lift us up we rise or fall together he taught them so they compromised and shortened it five foster homes three group homes some street life in between pop mike said so paul couldn t look him in the eye so no one makes it through that without survival skills which you have and you ve found a place here for four years and now you re just up and leaving the desk was a relic of the building s days as a school a general hospital and before that a mental hospital its round wood edge was uneven and worn as if the many kids trapped in this chair over the years had stared it away varnish and all paul shifted in the chair his side one big ache he hated hearing his life recited as if it were recorded and filed somewhere which it was the winter wind forced its way through the gaps between the cockeyed window sash and its frame a storm was due outside the fading daylight illuminated the wall of the adjacent building a cartoon ad peacock its paint battling to hang onto the decaying brick peddled a variety of pavo fruit juices new beginnings matters to you rumor was pop mike could go weeks without blinking look how you tried to save gonzales i told him to run for help he just ran paul had practiced this conversation how it would play out pop mike wouldn t mind that he was leaving if he did paul wouldn t sweat it yet he was unable to face the man the painted peacock smiled despite its sentence of death by crumbling its tail gathered in one fist bent outward in offering the feathers ended in a once vibrant assortment of bottles spread above the pavo slogan like leaves on a branch of a shade tree wake up to the rainbow wake up to your life decades of sun and rain had rendered the flavors unidentifiable in the grime and washed out hues paul could only guess at grape apple orange and watermelon you could apply for our next steps program work your way to an equivalency credential paul didn t bother to refuse that one again pop mike followed his gaze the all seeing eyes what the peacock in some asian faiths it s a symbol of mercy and empathy in others it s the all seeing eyes of the almighty what that one sees of course is a customer it s time for me to go paul touched his fingers to his eye which flared in protest this is how new york chose to tell me he prodded the bruise to see if he could make it hurt more he succeeded pop mike reached across the desk took hold of paul s wrist and gently pulled his hand away from his face he didn t let go until he was convinced paul wouldn t do it again that was the only way he could keep paul safe from himself please he said that s the one word i have left it won t work but i m saying it please paul twisted his ring michael alan peck tells tales big and small life s magical but it isn t always enough for a good story so he makes up the rest he s made his living writing about tv its celebrities and its past he s also put food on the table reviewing restaurants and writing about travel he has a godawful memory so he focuses on the written word he likes to think that over time he s gotten better at it the writing not the remembering he forgets important dates he s pretty good with movie lines but after several years he tends to tweak them he prefers his versions over the real ones funny goes a long way with him probably further than it should he grew up outside philadelphia and has lived in new york l a and san francisco his current home base is chicago website facebook twitter goodreads category

of conspiracy to manufacture piperidine cyclohexanolcarbonictrite pcp in violation of u s c ss a and the government then sought to enhance hamiltons sentence under section b a because he had a prior federal drug conspiracy conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine the government must follow u s c s which provides in pertinent part no person who stands convicted of an offense under this part shall be sentenced to increased punishment by reason of one or more prior convictions unless before trial the united states attorney files an information with the court and serves a copy of such information on the person or counsel for the person stating in writing the previous convictions to be relied upon clerical mistakes in the informa tion may be amended at any time prior to the pro nouncement of sentence u s c s a on september before trial the government filed a sentencing information alleging defendant frederick lamar hamilton prior to committing the offense alleged in count one of the indictment had been finally convicted of a felony under the laws of the united states relating to narcotic drugs namely on or about july in case number h in the united states district court for the western district of ten nessee defendant frederick lamar hamil ton was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of title united states code section emphasis added the information had the wrong year the prior judgment of conviction was entered on july not july everything else was correct the case number the court the charge the description of the prior offense the month of the conviction and the state in which he was convicted at an october arraignment on the sentencing information hamilton denied that he had been convicted of the charge set forth in the information the court in each of these counts of the informa tion the government intends to estab lish your prior convictions in order to enhance the sentence do you desire the taking of a plea on this counsel at this time yes your honor the court okay mr frederick hamilton do you admit or deny the allegations con tained in count hamilton deny the court you deny that you were convicted hamilton yes on january after trial but before sentencing the government filed an amended sentencing information changing the date to july this date was also technically incorrect july was when hamilton was previously sentenced not when the prior judgment of conviction was entered which was july the trial court refused to consider the prior federal conviction because the year on the original information was wrong and because the government offered insufficient proof of clerical error the court struck the amended information and indicated that if the sentencing information had been correct hamilton might have pled guilty before trial the court sentenced hamilton to months rather than the statutory minimum of months if the prior conviction was considered ii the government argues that the original sentencing information of september gave hamilton adequate notice of the governments intent to seek to enhance the sentence alternatively it contends that the wrong year was clerical error within the meaning of section a and was therefore subject to correction at any time before sentencing it asserts that the post trial amended sentencing information of january was such a correction the sufficiency of a section a sentencing information is a question of law reviewed de novo see united states v king f d th cir cert denied u s a defendant convicted of a drug offense under section a is subject to a possible enhanced sentence for prior convictions for felony drug offenses see u s c s b before a sentence can be enhanced the government must file an information stating in writing the previous conviction or convictions upon which it intends to rely see u s c s the information is mandatory the government must file it before trial or entry of a guilty plea see id if the requirement is not satisfied a court may not enhance a sentence even if a defendant has prior felony drug convictions see united states v layne f d th cir petition for cert filed u s dec no if a section information is filed the court must ask a defendant whether he or she affirms or denies the prior conviction and if challenged hold a hearing to address issues raised which would except the defendant from increased punishment see u s c s b c the ninth circuit requires strict compliance with the procedural aspects of section b see united states v garrett f d th cir vacating sentence for failure to comply with provision of section b we have not however previously addressed the substantive requirements of an information under section a nevertheless other circuits have faced similar situations and have published ample authority which is instructive here section a ensures proper notice so a defendant is able to challenge the information see united states v steen f d th cir it allows a defendant to make an informed decision about whether or not to plead guilty see kelly v united states f d th cir section a serves an additional purpose to inform the defendant that she faces severe consequences if convicted this procedure one would hope should lead to better informed decisions whether to proceed to trial united states v johnson f d th cir requiring information before jury selection begins reasoning in part that this allows the defendant ample time to determine whether he should enter a plea or go to trial and to plan his trial strategy with full knowledge of the consequences of a potential guilty verdict section a should be interpreted in a manner so as to avoid elevating form over substance king f d at here hamilton could not have been confused about the prior conviction the original information had the correct name case number court court location charge description of offense and date of conviction though not the year moreover the information alleged that hamilton was convicted in the western district of tennessee where he had been previously convicted on only one occasion it gave hamilton sufficient notice that the government was aware of his prior conviction and would seek to enhance his sentence under section b a hamilton received clear notice that the government intended to invoke section a see layne f d at reasoning in part that section a is silent on the specificity with which the government must identify prior convictions king f d at reversing preclusion of enhancement where information wrongly listed date of conviction because of apparent transposition error steen f d at upholding information with the wrong court number that incorrectly stated conviction for delivery rather than possession of cocaine but otherwise stated the correct date venue and case number united states v gonzalez lerma f d th cir upholding information with no prior case number date or place of conviction other than the state united states v campbell f d th cir upholding enhancement despite error in statutory section of previous conviction true the statute requires strict compliance with the procedural aspects an information must be timely filed before trial see e g neary v united states f d th cir it must be properly served see e g united states v weaver f d th cir the defendant must be allowed the opportunity to deny the prior conviction see garrett f d at nevertheless an apparent typographical mistake in a section a sentencing information that otherwise satisfies due process notice requirements does not render the information invalid to hold otherwise under these facts would elevat e form over substance king f d at as long as the information provides clear notice to a defendant of the prior convictions and the court gives an opportunity to attack convictions less than five years old then the statute has been satisfied see damerville v united states f d th cir due process demands only that adequate procedures be employed in determining when to include prior convictions in increasing a sentence procedures satisfy the requirements of due process by providing the defendant with reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard regarding the possibility of an enhanced sentence for recidivism citations and internal quotation omitted see also steen f d at gonzalez lerma f d at the government complied with section the trial court should have considered whether to enhance hamiltons sentence thus because the original information of september provided sufficient notice we need not address any issue regarding the amended information e g whether the trial court erred in striking it because it was not filed before trial or whether it corrected a clerical error in the original information iii for the foregoing reasons we vacate hamiltons sentence and remand for resentencing we offer no opinion on the merits of any challenge to the constitutionality of the prior conviction vacated and remanded honorable samuel p king senior united states district judge for the district of hawaii sitting by designation we affirm hamiltons conviction in a memorandum disposition filed separately the

which may not be less than years we grant the governments motion to expand the record to include a copy of the prior judgment of conviction hamilton challenged the prior conviction on multiple grounds first he argued that a felony drug conviction was impossible because in he was already in custody for the instant charge second he argued that the amended information was filed after trial contrary to

member of our kfor family bobby always knew he wanted to be a sports broadcaster and follow in the footsteps of his father bob barry sr he started his radio career as a sophomore at norman high school but had no idea he would continue down that path for another years after graduating from norman high school bobby decided to stay in town and attended the university of oklahoma in he graduated from ou with a bachelor s degree in radio television film journalism after leaving ou bobby became the sports director for kaut in oklahoma city just two years later he followed in his father s footsteps and joined kfor as a weekend sports anchor in bob barry jr and bob barry sr known for his off the wall attitude bobby became an instant classic in the hearts of oklahomans while bob barry sr was known to be a constant presence on the sports scene his son became a sportscaster that most everyone could relate to he never hid his opinions was always quick with a joke and was a wealth of knowledge after his father s retirement bobby took over the title of sports director for kfor since joining the kfor family he was awarded oklahoma sportscaster of the year six times by the national sportscasters and sportswriters association however bobby never tried to win awards for his work instead he got the greatest enjoyment out of doing something he loved and bringing information to sports fans during his time at kfor he became a beacon of light in the newsroom even during the darkest of times his bright personality made everyone feel welcome like they belonged he had a servant s heart in so many ways as talented as he was he was never he never acted like hey i m bob barry jr there was no bob barry jr he was just bobby said kent ogle that sparkling personality also caused a bit of chaos for producers since you never knew exactly what bobby would do or say at any moment bobby was a huge fan of the green bay packers and a proud partial owner how much of the team he actually owned was irrelevant to the argument he would always spare a moment to explain why the green bay packers are and always will be the greatest team in the nfl i worked for a couple of years in green bay when i got here the first thing he did was talk to me about the green bay packers and the times i went to lambeau field and he always assumed that i was a packers fan for eight years i was here and he would talk to me about every packers game about the packers and how aaron rodgers did he was such a good guy i never had the heart to break it to him that i grew up a bears fan said jesse wells and he always assumed that i was a packers fan he was such a good guy i never had the heart to break it to him that i grew up a bears fan and he always assumed that i was a packers fan he was such a good guy i never had the heart to break it to him that i grew up a bears fan he also had a passion to save the environment one dr pepper can at a time he started his mission in the newsroom collecting aluminum cans and plastic bottles to be recycled if coworkers made the mistake of throwing one out in the regular trash can bobby would be ready with an exasperated look and was always prepared to dig through the trash his one enemy in the newsroom the sports printer any issue that occurred during his sportscast was to blame on that printer even though he loved sports bobby loved his family even more he always said the happiest moments of his life included marrying the love of his life and the birth of his children he is survived by his wife the lovely gina his four children

general manager brian g torsey is a kinder friendlier version of paintball airsoft features millimeter biodegradable plastic airsoft bbs shot out of replica airsoft guns such as ak s and ak s they use electric powered batteries or compressed gas mr pearson said when a person is hit by one of the airsoft bbs they don t get a bruise which happens sometimes when someone is hit by a paintball it looks like a little mosquito bite said mr pearson a former internet network architect there s enough force to know you ve been hit he said mr torsey said people who have been hit by the airsoft bbs sometimes look like they have chickenpox citadel airsoft opened in an old factory building at suffolk st in the first floor of the airsoft headquarters will stay open and be available for people scheduled to shoot in sutton who are rained out the headquarters contains a pro shop where replica airsoft guns and other equipment are sold the first floor also features a television monitor where

pearson said while adding that to his knowledge there has never been a fatal injury involving airsoft mr pearson lives in uxbridge and has had his eye on the former drive in site for years i ve always thought that would be a good spot for what we do he said citadel flashpoint has scheduled what mr pearson called a soft opening today the event is a simulated military training session that is discussed on the company s website the area is scheduled to open officially the weekend of june having a sleepover is a little like giving birth while you are going through it you swear there is nothing that could convince you to ever do it again but once its over the pain fades from your memory in degrees until youre finally able to say i might consider trying that once more it wasnt so bad why would parents who seem to be sane according to every standard measure of rational behavior invite children to their house all together at the same time to eat cake drink soda toast marshmallows and then stay the whole night clearly there is no reasonable explanation for such a stunning lack of prudence my husband and i are particularly easy marks for the sleepover custom having hosted birthday sleepovers and many other impromptu all night events in our home this year however as we started to throw around ideas for our youngest sons birthday my husband almost cried when i told him it would probably be a sleepover no sleepovers this year please he begged lets just have them for a few hours some cake and ice cream and out the door we cant do that i countered his brother got a sleepover for every birthday for seven years we were younger my husband reminded me we had more energy we have to i said its the only fair thing to do our fate had been set in motion years ago when our eldest son invited year old boys to come live with us for pepsi infused hours that was the year of the soda fight which began in the playroom and proceeded gleefully throughout the house it is hard to decide whether that was worse though than the year of the airsoft gun party everyone is having airsoft gun parties our youngest said and it appeared to be true with the one exception that the other airsoft gun parties in his crowd had been limited to one short afternoon this one would involve hours of year olds playing out their mortal kombat fantasies in our back yard i remember how that party began i stood in the yard surrounded by boys carrying their airsoft guns and enumerated three rules one aim below the face two wear your goggles three no airsoft guns in the house they listened somber and attentive ok ok they said can we play now i nodded lets kill jacob one boy yelled where is he someone else asked in the house another shouted and they were off my rules no more substantial than dandelions in the wind i am still finding little yellow airsoft pellets under the beds in the corners clacking around in my vacuum cleaner i often step on them in the middle of the night as i make my way to the bathroom the best thing about a sleepover is when the last child leaves as my sons guests were vanishing after this years fete i could not help but reflect that there is no quiet as sweet as the one that settles on a home after a sleepover bye everetts mom the last boy said no trace left of the child who only hours earlier had flooded my laundry room in an attempt to create an indoor slip n slide he slung his unused sleeping bag over his shoulder thanks for inviting me its always a pleasure i said the pain already fading from my memory i watched him as he stepped jauntily into the morning light climbed into a car and was spirited away the cats came out of hiding peered around and joined the household once again the dogs worn out from trying to keep up with the nights debauchery sighed padded to the living room and began their daylong slumber my husband wandered in they all gone he asked a hopeful lilt in his voice yes i said thank god lets not do that again he

stepped up zoning enforcement the first selectman said thursday sending letters so far this month to property owners in violation of local rules the letters ask property owners to voluntarily comply with regulations on soil erosion parking large trucks and trailers in residential neighborhoods and other matters first selectman bill baxter said thursday further steps could include cease and desist orders and fines some residents contended last year that zoning enforcement was lax the focus of the residents ire was a harmony hill road business berkshire construction and saw cutting llc neighbors said the business had been operating illegally in the semi rural neighborhood and they were particularly alarmed by the owners plans to erect a large storage building on the property at harmony hill and cotton hill roads the application for that building has since been withdrawn baxter said the town is responding to the complaints by freeing up time for the administrative assistant in the land use office lynn charest to get out on the road and investigate violations charest is a certified zoning enforcement officer baxter said new hartford grand list grows less than expected new hartford the list of all taxable property increased by percent less than expected first selectman bill baxter said thursday town officials were expecting a percent to percent increase baxter said but both personal property and motor vehicle assessments from the october grand list were less than the previous year if total assessments in those two areas had stayed the same the overall increase in the grand list would have been about percent baxter said communities throughout the state saw the same drop in motor vehicle assessments an area that previously had been almost guaranteed to increase assessors have speculated that the decrease was driven by several factors including a substantial drop in the value of late model used cars total real estate assessments in new hartford had increased almost percent as a result of the recent revaluation town assessor gail sartori has said residential real estate assessments totaled million in compared with million the previous year commercial and industrial real estate assessments increased from million in to million according to figures sartori supplied to selectmen before adjustments by the board of assessment appeals the grand list is used to figure tax revenues for the coming fiscal year on the spending side the combined proposed budget for fiscal including the town local elementary education and the towns share of the region budget stood at a percent increase thursday before adjustments for municipal capital expenses baxter has submitted a budget that represents no increase over the previous year the local school boards capital expense budget is to increase by about percent due mostly to new computer purchases and work on the heating air conditioning and ventilation baxter said windsor locks man charged with threatening windsor locks a vernon man has been arrested on threatening charges in connection with an altercation at the bradley international inn on old county road lawrence d leavitt of kelly road vernon was

url222,irrelevant,theodore elaster jr et al v hamilton county department of education et al court of appeals of tennessee at knoxville june session filed july april elaster pro se appellant d scott bennett and mary c de camp chattanooga tennessee for the appellees hamilton county department of education edward rowe and carol thomas d michael swiney c j delivered the opinion of the court in which john w mcclarty and arnold b goldin jj joined d michael swiney chief judge this appeal arises from an alleged assault of a student by a school employee april elaster mother filed a lawsuit against the hamilton county department of education dean of students edward rowe rowe and part time school administrator carol thomas thomas collectively defendants in the circuit court for hamilton county the trial court on behalf of her minor son theodore elaster jr the child mother alleged that rowe assaulted the child and her various counts arose from that alleged assault after a trial the trial court entered judgment in favor of defendants finding that any collision between rowe and the child was unintentional mother appeals to this court we find that the evidence does not preponderate against the trial courts finding that the alleged assault did not happen and this finding serves to defeat all of mothers claims we affirm the judgment of the trial court this case centers on a may incident at dalewood middle school when the child then a seventh grade student collided with rowe in a hallway mother filed a complaint on her sons behalf against defendants in the trial court alleging violation of civil rights under u s c negligent supervision negligent retention common law assault common law battery intentional infliction of emotional distress negligent infliction of emotional distress and common law negligence mother alleged that rowe assaulted the child rowe on the other hand has denied throughout this case that he intentionally struck the child but rather that any contact in the hallway was unintentional on his part this case was removed to the united states district court the claim was dismissed in the united states district court the remaining tennessee governmental tort liability claims raised by mother were remanded for resolution in the trial court the child told guidance counselor ashley medley that rowe had struck him medley brought the matter to thomass attention no injuries to the child were visible when asked the child said that another student had witnessed the incident the student trevon h trevon stated that the child had tripped rowe when questioned about the incident rowe acknowledged that the two had collided however rowe denied intentionally striking the child stating instead that he accidentally hit him with his elbow while regaining his balance thomas concluded that the childs version of events was not the true one when weighed against the other two eyewitness accounts of rowe and trevon thomas explained to the child and mother that if the matter were pursued it would result in the childs expulsion for kicking a teacher under the zero tolerance policy at trial the child testified that rowe intentionally struck him trevons testimony vacillated initially trevon denied having stated that the child tripped rowe trevon was confronted with his earlier account stating that the child tripped rowe which he acknowledged as true mother testified that she took the child to the hospital five days after the incident and he was diagnosed with a contusion in november the trial court entered its final judgment the trial court found in favor of defendants on all counts in its final judgment the trial court stated as follows emphasis added mother filed an appeal to this court mother presents the following issue for review on appeal whether the decision of the circuit court should be overturned and the case remanded for further proceedings when the court issued a ruling that was not based on any legal explanation as to why the defendant department of education was not accountable for the protection of a minor child assaulted by an adult on school property during school hours and the decision did not address issues of liability on eight of the nine issues presented our review is de novo upon the record accompanied by a presumption of correctness of the findings of fact of the trial court unless the preponderance of the evidence is otherwise tenn r app p d bogan v bogan s w d tenn a trial courts conclusions of law are subject to a de novo review with no presumption of correctness s constructors inc v loudon county bd of educ s w d tenn as our supreme court has instructed hughes v metro govt of nashville and davidson county s w d tenn on appeal mother argues that she and her son were denied access to justice because the trial court failed to rule specifically on each count raised in her complaint however the dispositive issue is whether the trial courts order is sufficient to dispose of all claims raised by mother and whether the trial court erred in ruling as it did on the merits of mothers claims all of mothers claims arise out of the alleged incident between the child and rowe at dalewood middle school on may in mothers presentation of her issue for review in her brief on appeal she frames the matter in relevant part as why the defendant department of education was not accountable for the protection of a minor child assaulted by an adult on school property the problem with mothers assertion is that it assumes as fact that an assault took place the trial court did not reach that conclusion and instead found that any collision that occurred between rowe and the child was inadvertent in nature mothers claims depend entirely on an assault having taken place it is therefore incumbent upon mother to demonstrate that the evidence preponderates against the trial courts factual finding as to the collision having carefully reviewed the record on appeal we find that the evidence does not preponderate against the trial courts finding the only firsthand witness to the incident to state consistently that the child was assaulted was the child himself trevons testimony was inconsistent rowe testified that while he collided with the child he never intentionally struck the child the trial court implicitly made credibility determinations as was its prerogative in determining which version of events was the correct one we affirm the judgment of the trial court the judgment of the trial court is affirmed and this cause is remanded to the trial

colleagues clients or customers or inquire about permissions licensing please go to edmonton minutes before community organizer bashir mohamed was scheduled to discuss his latest advocacy efforts on live radio he caught wind of a warning that edmonton catholic schools could be taking legal action against him the first thought that crossed his mind mohamed said was how dare they on nov mohamed participated in a silent protest at the edmonton catholic schools ecs board meeting to demand an apology for how staff handled a september incident involving year old student emmell summerville and his mother una momolu after summerville was asked by school officials to remove a durag he was wearing as an advocate for momolu mohamed was slated to speak about that latest development in the now two month ordeal on a thursday morning radio program as a guest on ched s the ryan jespersen show however as host ryan jespersen noted at the top of the segment the station was warned about ten minutes before the interview that there may be pending legal action against mohamed which could extend to the station if the particulars of the case were discussed on the live broadcast on friday jesperson responded to the warning which he attributed to a phone call from an ecs spokesperson who advised the station that the school board might be pursuing a defamation lawsuit against mohamed and that the station could be named in the lawsuit if it was used as a platform for defamation if you heard me talking to bashir mohamed because like hell i m going to cancel that interview you know that we had to tread carefully and lightly jesperson said in his response on friday the radio host went on to compare the warning to a strategic lawsuit against public participation otherwise known as a slapp which organizations or individuals can use to silence their critics monday afternoon ecs spokesperson lori nagy said she issued a call to corus entertainment which owns ched based on comments mohamed has made about school board staff in the past comments ecs believes are defamatory as we are legally obligated to provide not only our students but also our staff with a safe and caring environment free of harassment any defamatory comments about our staff are of significant concern to the division nagy said in a statement to star edmonton following thursday s radio interview mohamed said he immediately sought a lawyer to find out if he was involved in any legal action but after checking with the court mohamed said his lawyer found no active lawsuit against him however as a result of the call the broadcast interview instead explored mohamed s reasons for getting involved after briefly outlining the original event involving momolu s son that motivated the latest protest the most messed up thing is that the catholic school board through legal threats was able to derail and effectively cancel an interview about this issue mohamed said instead we had to talk about something else when asked how the school board responded to allegations that the call was an attempt to intimidate or silence conversations surrounding momolu s story nagy said she could not comment in september momolu s son who was then attending christ the king school was asked by school officials to remove his red durag a durag is a head garment originally worn by african american slaves in the th century that has since become an emblem of black culture officials said he was asked to remove it because it contravened a policy prohibiting headwear at the school momolu said a youth adviser at the school a former member of the edmonton police service called her to inform her of the incident she maintains that the adviser asked both her and her son if he was affiliated with a gang because red durags have been connected to gang activity in edmonton momolu then met with the school s principal to address her concerns about the incident she believes her son was racially profiled ecs claims the mother s behaviour at the meeting escalated which resulted in a call to police and a ban that barred momolu from christ the king school for the remainder of the school year summerville has since been transferred to another school in the district but his mother continues to contest the ban noting that it prevents her from picking up young relatives who still attend christ the king school her efforts have included multiple protests at ecs s lumen christi catholic education centre in downtown edmonton the school board claims that the adviser never asked if the student was gang affiliated and it has since apologized for its use of the word gang in the incident and noted that the term was not intended to allege that the student was affiliated with a gang but rather to provide context for the sake of the student s safety for momolu however that s not enough she is also seeking an apology for how she says ecs has treated her and her son and a review of the school s headwear policy early in november momolu was scheduled to meet with ecs officials to discuss her outstanding concerns she wanted community members including mohamed to attend for support given the outcome of her last meeting with the principal of christ the king school however that meeting was cancelled since the school board only discusses incidents involving students with the parents or guardians of those students as a result momolu has taken her concerns to the province on nov momolu and mohamed met with alberta education minister adriana la grange momolu said she was assured that there would be an investigation into the incident according to nagy ecs has complied with all of the province s requests regarding the incident mohamed said that while the last two months and the last week in particular have been frustrating the legal warning is not going to stop him from speaking out if anyone knows me he added they know that has the opposite effect with files from kashmala fida copyright

hodges doughty carson and paul d hogan jr of morton lewis king krieg knoxville for plaintiff appellant evans rom meares of meares meares maryville barry k maxwell and donald f paine of egerton mc afee armistead davis knoxville for defendants appellants perkeys charles clifford of garner clifford maryville for defendants appellees willeys permission to appeal denied by supreme court december sanders judge these appeals are from a judgment of the trial court sustaining motions for summary judgment to an original complaint and also a counter complaint this litigation has its genesis in a suit filed by the defendants appellants nancy perkey and gary perkey against the plaintiff appellant dr samuel b evans and blount memorial hospital inc for medical malpractice the suit was filed on october in the circuit court of blount county by defendants appellees attorneys lorrie willie and d t willey practicing law under the firm name of willey and willey the original suit alleged dr evans and blount memorial hospital inc were guilty of medical malpractice resulting in the death of kelly ann perkey to whom nancy perkey gave premature birth on january on august the perkeys and willey and willey attorneys filed a notice of voluntary nonsuit in accordance with rule of tennessee rules of civil procedure on august an order was entered by the court dismissing the suit without prejudice on august dr evans filed suit in the circuit court against mr and mrs perkey and lorrie and d t willey for malicious prosecution and abuse of process the complaint alleged the action was instituted with improper intent and without probable cause and there was improper use of process with improper intent the defendants lorrie willey and d t willey filed a motion for summary judgment alleging there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and filed a number of supporting affidavits the perkeys filed an answer denying the allegations of malicious intent or lack of probable cause they also relied upon advice of counsel they then filed a motion for summary judgment alleging there was no genuine issue of any material facts on august perkeys filed a complaint and counter complaint against dr evans and blount memorial hospital inc alleging again medical malpractice resulting in the death of their daughter kelly ann perkey dr evans and blount memorial hospital inc each filed a motion for summary judgment they each alleged the cause of action was barred by the statute of limitations in that the suit was brought more than one year after the alleged wrongful act as provided in t c a they also alleged the suit was brought more than one year after the taking of the nonsuit and does not come within the savings statute of t c a dr evans in his motion also said mr and mrs perkey failed to request or obtain leave of the court to set up or assert a counter claim as required by rule t r c p the hospital in its motion said also it is a governmental entity as defined in t c a and it was not given written notice as required by t c a it also relied upon t c a it said the counter plaintiffs failed to apply for or obtain leave of the court to set up a counter claim by amendment as required by rule t r c p it also asserted the cross complainants are not entitled to make it a party to the cross complaint under the provisions of rule or t r c p the case does not stand for a jury trial as to it under t c a and the limit of its liability under t c a and is extensive pretrial depositions were taken and the court upon consideration of the entire record found the complaint and cross complaint was barred by the one year statute of limitations as set out in t c a and he also found the suit was not refiled in accordance with the requirements of t c a upon making this finding the court stated he found it unnecessary to rule on the remaining grounds of the motions by dr evans and the hospital to dismiss and sustained the motion for summary judgment the perkeys then moved orally to withdraw their motion for summary judgment and set up their action against dr evans as a counter claim in accordance with rule t r c p but this motion was overruled the court also sustained a motion for summary judgment as to lorrie willey and dolores t willey and dismissed the suit as to them dr evans took a nonsuit as to the perkeys leaving nothing pending for determination by the court mr and mrs perkey have appealed from the action of the court in dismissing their complaint and counter complaint and dr evans has appealed from the action of the court in sustaining the motion for summary judgment in favor of lorrie and dolores t willey mr and mrs perkey have presented the following issues for review i what act or event designates the date of commencement for the one year period prescribed by the tennessee savings statute t c a ii should the trial court have allowed the plaintiffs motion to set up their claim as an omitted counterclaim pursuant to rule and rule tennessee rules of civil procedure the real question for determination on the first issue is whether the one year statute of limitations for reinstituting a suit under the savings clause of t c a starts from the day notice is given under rule t r c p that a nonsuit is taken or the day when an order of the court is entered dismissing the suit without prejudice rule of tennessee rules of civil procedure provides on august the perkeys and their attorneys filed the following notice the plaintiffs do hereby notify the defendants in this cause that they are exercising their right to take a voluntary non suit in accordance with the tennessee rules of civil procedure rule and that as of this date the action is dismissed on august the following order was entered by the court in this cause came the plaintiffs by and through their attorneys and filed a notice of non suit in the above styled cause on the th day of august in accordance with rule tennessee rules of civil procedure therefore it is ordered that this cause be dismissed without prejudice to the plaintiffs and that the costs of this cause be taxed to the plaintiffs for which execution may issue if necessary the plaintiffs reside at route grey ridge road maryville tennessee t c a provides the complaint and counter complaint was filed on monday august which is considerably more than one year after the filing of the original notice of nonsuit on august and two days beyond a year from the filing of the order entered august however august fell on saturday rule t r c p provides the end result is that the complaint was filed within one year as extended from the entry of the court order both the right to take a nonsuit without prejudice and the right to refile the suit within one year from the dismissal have been provided for in our statutes in this jurisdiction for more than a century however prior to the adoption of the tennessee rules of civil procedure the matter of taking a nonsuit as a matter of right was not uniform between the circuit and chancery courts it is clear from the committees comments that the purpose in adopting rule was to liberalize the rule in chancery cases and to make the rule uniform between chancery and circuit courts prior to the adoption of rule our courts uniformly held that the one year time period allowed under t c a ran from the time the judgment or decree was rendered these cases are so numerous and varied we do not deem citations supportive of this holding either necessary or appropriate as we now read rule and t c a together we find no conflict between the two nor do we read anything in either of them which would mandate a change from precedent procedure prior to the adoption of rule t r c p there was confusion in some areas as to when a judgment or decree was considered to be effective the committee comments under rule state this rule is designed to make uniform across the state the procedure for entry of judgments and to make certain the effective date of the judgment as pertinent here the rule provides the entry of a judgment shall be when it is signed by the judge and filed with the clerk the effective date of a judgment shall be the date of filing dr evans and the hospital rely strongly upon the case of rickets v sexton tenn s w d as supportive of their insistence that the one year statute begins to run from the giving of written notice of nonsuit rather than the date of judgment they say the following pronouncement of the court mandates such a holding while we find the appellants argument is persuasive we do not find the rickets case to be controlling in the case at bar at first blush the reading of the third sentence quoted above would indicate that nothing more than the written notice is necessary to finalize the case however this statement of the court is dicta and not necessarily pertinent to the rickets case or to the case at bar in rickets the court was concerned with the right of a party to take a voluntary nonsuit and the lack of the power of the court to deprive him of that right we construe the rickets court to be saying that the plaintiff in that case had done all that was required to be done when he gave written notice of his intention to take a nonsuit it was not necessary for the court to grant permission or enter an order permitting it to be done however we do not find the court to be saying that a judgment or decree need not be entered for final adjudication of a case both the appellants and the appellees rely upon the cases of snell v leffew tenn app s w d and cantrell v humana of tennessee inc tenn app s w d as supportive of their positions we fail to find either of them controlling here they in effect hold that where an oral statement was made prior to trial that a nonsuit would be taken and no written notice was given as required by the rule the effective date of the nonsuit for the running of the statute was the day on which the order was entered dismissing the suit it will be observed that rule provides for filing a written notice if a nonsuit is to be taken at any time before trial it also provides it may be taken by oral notice during the trial all rights and privileges of the parties are the same whether the notice be oral or written we do not perceive that the written notice has any greater dignity before the court or that either stands in a different posture can it be said that an oral statement during the trial of the case that a nonsuit is taken constitutes a judgment or decree rendered against the plaintiff upon grounds not concluding his right of action as provided in t c a we think the question answers itself it is a well established principle of law in this jurisdiction that we conclude the one year statute of limitations ran from the date of the entry of the order of the court and not from the date of filing the notice of nonsuit in view of our holding on appellants first issue the second issue is pretermitted this brings us to consideration of the insistence of dr evans that the court was in error in sustaining the motion for summary judgment as to lorrie willey and d t willey while the majority of reported cases for malicious prosecution in this jurisdiction involve the prosecution for a criminal offense it is a well recognized rule in this state that such suit may be maintained for actions brought in civil cases as well buda v cassel bros inc tenn app s w d and cases cited therein the plaintiff premised his complaint on two separate actions for alleged misuse of legal process by the defendants  abuse of process and malicious prosecution an action for abuse of process lies for the use of legal process to obtain a result it was not intended to effect for wrongful purposes malicious prosecution or the malicious use of process is the employment of legal process for its obstensible purpose but without probable cause donaldson v donaldson tenn s w d id to make out a claim of malicious prosecution a plaintiff must show that the defendant with malice instituted legal proceedings against him without probable cause and the proceedings terminated in his favor s w d id at the affidavits filed by the willeys in support of their motion for summary judgment show that before bringing suit they consulted with their clients some five hours they examined the hospital and medical records of both mrs perkey and her deceased daughter they read books to acquaint themselves with medical procedures in obstetrics and how to proceed in medical malpractice cases they interviewed one witness who was in the labor room with mrs perkey before she was transferred to the delivery room they were unaware of any malicious intent of mr and mrs perkey toward dr evans and they personally had none they filed a thorough and artfully drawn complaint on behalf of their clients which alleged a cause of action the pretrial deposition of mrs perkey substantiates the allegations of the complaint in dr evans pretrial deposition he admitted that had he been guilty of the wrongful acts alleged in the complaint it would have constituted medical malpractice there was no showing by counter affidavits or depositions that the complaint filed by the willeys on behalf of their clients was filed out of malice or without probable cause we think the following question and answer in dr evans pretrial deposition characterizes his contention q i take it doctor simply put your complaint against the perkeys and the willeys is because you say what mrs perkey has been saying in the previous lawsuit simply isnt true a yes in malicious prosecution cases the question of probable cause is one for the court and not the jury in the case of cohen v cook tenn s w d our supreme court addressed this question and speaking through chief justice dyer said under the proof and the law applicable to the case we find no error in the trial courts sustaining the motion for summary judgment as to lorrie and d t willey the judgment of the trial court in dismissing the complaint and counter complaint on the grounds it was barred by the statute of limitations is reversed insofar as it sustained the motion for summary judgment it is affirmed the case is remanded to the trial court for a determination of the remaining issues raised on the respective motions for summary judgment pretermitted by him and a proper disposition of the case in keeping with this opinion the cost of this appeal is taxed to dr evans and blount memorial hospital inc parrott p j and franks j concur newsletter sign up to

url278,irrelevant,the parents of four black high school students plan to file a million lawsuit against the longwood central school district after a high school teacher created a slideshow that featured a picture of a gorilla followed by an image of the boys with a caption that was outrageously offensive the students lawyer said credit newsday cecilia dowd chris ware the parents of four black high school students have given notice they intend to file a federal civil rights suit against the longwood central school district after a science teacher created a slideshow that featured a picture of an ape followed by an image of the boys with the captions monkey see and monkey do a notice of claim a precursor to the planned million lawsuit was served on the school district wednesday the notice alleges the administration of longwood high school threatened to suspend one of the students after he shot a video of the power point presentation on his phone and then shared it on social media attorney john ray who represents the four students said the photos compiled and displayed in a power point presentation in the classroom by science teacher edward heinrichs were outrageously offensive ray said the images insulted and humiliated the young men who range in age from to and are all honors students at the school this is not just a case of racism ray said at a news conference in miller place this is a case of someone asserting racial inferiority of african american people khevin beaubrun a senior from middle island who was in the photo captured part of the slideshow on his smartphone and uploaded it to snapchat where he suggested that he and his friends were staged to look like slaves hours later beaubrun said he was brought to the principals office and told to delete the post or risk immediate suspension he rejected the request and was not suspended i am really disappointed because i trusted my teacher he said as an educator i give him my trust to take the photo and i did not think it was going to be portrayed in that way the longwood central school district declined to comment citing the pending litigation the pandemic has changed education on long island find out how by clicking sign up you agree to our privacy policy in a statement monday the district conceded the photo and caption were culturally insensitive but said the teacher did not intend to mock the students the teacher has made slideshows from past zoo trips with similar monkey see monkey do captions featuring white students parents said for the past several years the high school teacher has taken a similar photo for use in a classroom power point presentation said the statement indicating that heinrichs has undergone sensitivity training this particular photo was an unfortunate lapse of judgment without the intent of doing so the photo was taken without fully understanding the sensitivity or the hurt it may have caused and reminds us that we must be more aware of the feelings of our multicultural population heinrichs did not respond to messages and email requests for comment a message left with the middle island teachers association which represents longwood teachers was not returned ray asked the commissioner of the state department of education to investigate the conduct of the schools administration and to order the suspension and potential termination of the teachers involved in the slideshow a department official declined to comment noting that the commissioner may be required to rule on an appeal arising from the case the pictures taken by another teacher during a nov trip to the bronx zoo were shown to two advanced zoology classes on dec before the december break the slideshow includes a picture of a monkey with the caption monkey see in the next picture the students can be seen standing behind each other in size order with their hands on each others heads with the caption monkey do the next picture is of a gorilla ray contends the photo of the students was intended to look like the march of progress a commonly used illustration intended to show million years of human evolution with man evolving over time from apes to homo sapiens the racist trope comparing african americans to apes dates back generations and has been used to justify slavery and jim crow segregation according to historians i was horrified because african americans have been through this already and it s coming back again said desmond dent jr of coram who was pictured in the photo we should not be compared to any animal georgette grier key president of the brookhaven town naacp said the incident goes beyond cultural insensitivity we cant sit by and allow the greatest gift on earth our children to be left in the hands of adults that are bullies ignorant unqualified ill equipped or insensitive grier key wrote in a letter to district officials wednesday parents contend a prior slideshow by the same teacher was also offensive in a meeting last week to discuss the incident school administrators showed parents previous years slideshows according to butch murray whose grandson gykye was in the photo a presentation murray said featured a picture of a lion followed by a photo of three african american female students with the caption not all animals are cute this made the hair on the back of my neck stand up murray said of the slideshow featuring his grandson the four boys say for now they have been encouraged by the administration not to return to the science class and that they should expect to receive a grade of incomplete for the class ray contends the students should be provided at home tutoring to make up for the lost classroom education and that the two science teachers should be removed from the class

concern none were found ryan was up front and honest about any and all areas of concern for the present or possible future he gave me the option for another maintenance service but did not force me

alumni hall saint james dima zdor soars for a dunk against flint hill on wednesday night saint james amir harris soars to the basket between flint hill defenders during wednesday night s mid atlantic conference game at alumni hall saint james dima zdor soars for a dunk against flint hill on wednesday night st james playing in the backcourt last season at st maria goretti with elijah clarance amir harris got an up close look at how to rise in the clutch on wednesday night he showed he was paying attention with his current team saint james in dire straits harris delivered like his unflappable former teammate draining a pointer with seconds left to give the saints a mid atlantic conference victory over flint hill harris clutch stuff was by design coming out of a timeout with the saints down by a point callum baker lobbed an inbounds pass from the baseline finding harris on the left wing without hesitation the senior gathered the ball behind the point line rose without a dribble and fired for his th th and th points of the night i was thinking somebody was going to be in front of me harris said but they left me open so it was a shot i was going to take it went in i ll take it saint james coach dan prete wanted the ball in harris hands it was up to him what to do with it i put him in that situation a big popping out prete said he was either going to be open or he was going to the hole with this group right now without bryce golden i like a leader to take over and he s a veteran with the pittsburgh bound golden day to day with a minor injury saint james needed the best stuff of harris who scored his season high to go along with his three steals and five assists and senior dima zdor points rebounds who overcame foul trouble to play brilliantly in the fourth quarter when he tallied nine of his points and eight of his boards on friday night also with golden sidelined saint james got another big mac win over maret as harris and zdor combined for points and rebounds with harris adding six assists and zdor contributing five blocks the last week and a half harris has really stepped up as a leader prete said he s talking to the guys and really evolving as more of a player understanding how to run a team rather than make a play harris play helped the saints escape on a night when they committed turnovers i don t think we had a lot of energy tonight prete said but i m proud of the guys for fighting through and grinding through that type of game to get a win that s growth when you don t play well and you can still figure it out one thing the saints did well particularly with the golden out was deal with flint hill s junior standout qudus wahab who was limited to points and six rebounds after entering with averages of points and boards we expected to see bryce tonight but we didn t said flint hill coach ricardo reed but even without him they re really long trailing midway through the third quarter saint james was in trouble but baker hit a pointer and later in the period he made free throws to open and close a point run during the spree baker also had a steal and helped force a backcourt violation saint james hiked its lead to five points early in the fourth quarter as harris drove for a layup and zdor added a pair of free throws but flint hill battled back behind senior guard isaiah moore points then late in the game sophomore justice ellison seven points eight rebounds hit buckets on consecutive possessions with less than two minutes left zdor took a feed from miller and knocked down a to give the saints the lead when senior justin taylor six points seven rebounds answered with a runner the huskies were back up setting the scene for harris helping prepare him for the moment were his memories of clarance who hit three game winning pointers last season all in the final second in huge victories over mount st joseph de matha and saint james i learned a lot going against clarance every day pushing me every day harris said he made me a better player to some he looked like superman harris put his cape on reed said he made some big time plays saint james callum baker amir harris dima zdor anthony garcia jalen miller jordan miller

url437,irrelevant,jaspreet singh after c more bad news started pouring in from italy and france and spain switzerland one of the most affected countries declared a nationwide emergency this writer s residency in a small village in switzerland on the gentle slopes of the jura mountains was going to shut down indefinitely i packed my suitcase not knowing what awaited me it was near impossible to contact the airline the day i packed my bags was followed by a long night when i got my first anxiety attack of i recovered certain i was not going to let it become as bad as it had after i was fine fortunately the head of the residency made a generous exception for the last two remaining writers me and a novelist from germany we were allowed to continue and self isolate in our studios studios designed with solitude in mind if i stay here i thought i will also make way for someone who needs to return to canada more urgently than i do it is lockdown and quarantine more or less all over the world here i will be able to walk and reflect and write i thought i was fine with the föhn winds all that is solid melts in the air and the unnecessary spring bees ladybugs electric spark houseflies and small leaves fledged i was not able to write but i was fine surveying the dystopian world online and witnessing the collapse of fictions most countries in the world tell about themselves until a fortnight later a boulder heavy band gripped around my chest a near continuous shortness of breath a sore throat and a nose eye infection and insatiable thirst for water contagion no said the stoic village doctor no he said no when he visited me the second time what you are going through is extreme levels of anxiety the thing was exacerbated by my ptsd connected to surviving the pogroms in india in he opened his home healthcare shoulder bag and took out a benzodiazepine medication he had lots of lorazepams in his black bag there was more than a metre s distance between us and yet we could not look each other in the eye what if my negative test result the nose swab sample analyzed by the lab was actually a false negative i asked the doctor readjusted his facemask so did i both worried about ourselves and each other and i knew the first few scenes the opening chapters of the rest of my life both the doctor and i in strange solidarity waiting for now for afterwardsness if such a thing remains possible in a world gone logarithmically ambiguous the only certainty this catastrophe will be followed by yet another perhaps both of us in silent agreement that there was still room for hope in an epoch of unhope that in the days ahead what we each person on this planet do and what we don t do and what is done to us may change our highly interconnected lives and our planet more than a world changed by a virus jasmina odor hard sharp and dangerous in those early march days when the epidemic became a pandemic i was home with a newborn my first baby he had arrived during that deadly week in january when edmonton was locked down by unceasing temperatures in the minus forties we took him home from the hospital in the evening darkness of that cold on roads completely covered in hard ice the baby bundled and tiny and squished looking in the brand new car seat my husband turning off the main road into our neighbourhood as soon as he could losing his nerve with the usual traffic before the elation of bringing the baby into the warm house we were tense and terrified of any inadvertent slip not being able to stop at a light skidding out on a turn once home i thought i never want to leave this house again in the weeks that followed i paid only peripheral attention to covid when i met a friend for coffee on my first outing sans baby and she suggested we plan a visit with both our families before the pandemic hits i was surprised of course she was right within a few weeks we were all in lockdown the pandemic is in fact much like first time parenthood few things make us feel as vulnerable as being the sole guardians of tiny helpless beings we want so much to thrive and thrive in safety you can no longer for instance see anything in your house not in relation to your child s safety there s a quality of terror as if the light has changed slightly to suddenly reveal innocent objects as hard and sharp and dangerous and covid has given us an equivalent of that vulnerability on a social and global scale the danger seems everywhere in all the ordinary and until recently harmless things of our daily lives our grocery cart our mail the friendly family passing us on the trail our parents and friends as with a baby the risk is low but the consequence potentially so terrible that we dare not relax our vigilance and of course we can t anyway because in the case of this pandemic one person s risk is every other person s risk we are not staying safe only for ourselves and that is the other stark thing covid has highlighted for me the way the health of one of us is related to the health of all of us just as a baby s well being depends not only on its parents but also in a foundational way on the whole social familial and economic net it finds itself in something akin to water to a fish hard to see with any perspective because it is so taken for granted one wishes we could apply this obvious connection to all our social structures and that when the next pandemic hits we could really be in it together equally not just theoretically sid marty the old geezer s shopping hour our friend beth phoned and learned that our eldest son paul was staying overnight in our little guest shack give him a hug for me she said myrna said no we have to keep our distance oh said beth sadly well just poke him with a stick then for a rural freelance writer the covid crisis is otherwise a bit surreal there are not enough hours in a day for me to keep up with the maintenance on our small holding the season is announced by the chorus frogs and the common snipe and confirmed by a sudden charm of goldfinches as we watch the skies anxiously for late arrivals and social distancing i ve been doing that since about if not for my wife i would turn into a complete hermit but on our weekly trip into pincher creek for the geezer only shopping hour we come face to face with masked strangers our neighbours and the peril suddenly gets real still covid is mainly an urban stalker cancer and heart disease thrive everywhere we re in the cane and pain demographic a lonely place of disappearing friends two of them in the last week alone in the grocery store lineup white haired neighbours eye each other over their outlaw bandanas and wonder who s next like clay pigeons in a shooting arcade we totter along our predetermined track then it s as if a shot rings out because bing one of us goes down never to rise again i m distracted from the pain in the outer world by the terrific pain my wife suffers every day in her joints they are bone on bone meanwhile alberta is the only jurisdiction on earth where the doctors are suing the health minister in the middle of the pandemic they say they will withdraw from the local hospital in july we support them but this is an awful worry my wife is one of thousands of albertans some waiting over two years for so called elective surgery who will now face even longer delays while hospitals operate below capacity waiting for the next wave of covid she can no longer get down and dirty in her garden which is the centre of her life at this time of year what we needed were some planters about high to allow for stand up gardening the local building supply risky to enter these days was down to boards this is where thank god i m a country boy kicks in my neighbour has a small sawmill that turns out rough stock i ve got a bunch of salvaged s lying around here also he said take em all if you want and so i found myself happily at work building two eight foot long planters with doubled legs to take the weight of soil the red squirrels and chipmunks watched me with interest they have learned to follow behind myrna and dig up every seed she plants so i framed four screens made of wire mesh no cheeky little varmint can penetrate we hear about the record numbers of city people pouring into the garden centres this is something we all have in common a desire to grow food in uncertain times to connect ourselves to a nurturing earth despite all the pain and grief around us a desire to make ourselves whole again as we weather these desperate days of the plague katherine govier scrabble addict my name is katherine and i am a scrabble addict i m nervous to be zooming with you all but at least i m here i grew up in a scrabble playing family my father wasn t as good as my mother so they fought when she proved her word with the dictionary he claimed that the dictionary was wrong or that the word was not english when i had no friends to play with i d get out the scrabble board and make words when i got a bingo i d run into the kitchen to tell mum hey look i used all seven of my letters she would say isn t that wonderful then i d go back out to the living room and select a bunch of great letters that fit onto my previous word put them down and run into the kitchen again and say look i did it again the second time she d appear quizzical but she never called me on it when my first marriage broke up scrabble was a factor my husband did not like to lose we had our biggest fight about whether you could pluralize the word rice i was sure you could and he said you couldn t i had the s and it led to a triple word score after the divorce my sister introduced me to a guy across the street as a kid he had driven all over the prairies with his mother attending scrabble tournaments when he pulled his board out of its own little handmade quilted carry bag i knew i was dead he beat me no rematch the next man i married played scrabble at first then he quit claiming he never got good letters my son was more of a chess type so he was out it got down to where only my daughter would play with me the games were grim and went on for hours but those days it was face to face the downward spiral started when i got into playing online on facebook on websites with anyone strangers dozens at a time there was never enough no matter how many games i had going the moment came when i d played all my turns and had to sit there with nothing to do this is in front of my computer where i used to actually write books i swore it wasn t affecting my life but it was an obsession at night i was always running up to my office first thing in the morning too my husband had to stand at the foot of the stairs and shout for me i d hear his footsteps and close the screen so he couldn t see what i was doing before covid i tried to quit i swore i would stay away from the computer work in the garden and read books then came the virus it threw me back more than ever to the tiles i read about scrabblers anonymous online your stories have made me see there s more to life than keeping my ratings up maybe if i stick with this program i can get back to writing one day sharon butala the unbearable return what made it all so strange was that for the first month i didn t know a single person who was sick not even anyone who knew anyone who was sick much less had died while on television i watched videos of hazmat clad doctors and nurses clustered thickly around beds working on the tube riddled unresponsive bodies of the dying starting with videos out of wuhan china where i saw a man neatly attired in a black suit stretched out on his back on the street dead in the night someone must have put him there on to smuggled cell phone video of a hospital with bodies lying so thickly on the floor there was no room to walk among them staff in virtual hysterics and where chaos reigned to videos of our own calmer less congested if still fiercely alert hospitals with their fast moving face masked blue gowned and gloved staff yet at the same time when i looked out the windows of my condo i saw the same playing fields the two schools the houses sitting as they always had in quiet rows no one about other than one or two sauntering by usually with a leashed dog no sirens no ambulances almost no planes flying over nothing just a silence so great it was eerie i couldn t reconcile the two realities i kept waiting for them to make sense even while i obeyed the isolation and distancing rules and didn t go to the grocery store more than once a week and otherwise pretty much nowhere i listened to the radio and watched newscast after newscast on television switching channels trying to grasp the enormity of the crisis without succumbing to the sneaking fear that it would all end in food riots lootings and heaps of untended bodies piled in the streets or equally as time passed and the crisis continued to seem distant and unreal restraining myself from simply saying to hell with it and going to the mall or its equivalent just to break the tension much could be said here about the isolation of the old and yet my surprising first reaction to the imposed self isolation had been relief good i said to myself now i don t have to pretend i m normal meaning i can stay home without wondering if i m missing some exciting or interesting happening while also feeling guilty and inadequate because i truly am an introvert and mostly i d rather stay home alone or with a friend or two for company and that is seen in our culture as abnormal and unhealthy but by the end of week seven when the talk of lifting restrictions began and still i hadn t personally witnessed any of it and nobody i knew had been seriously ill or died mixed with relief that the crisis was really ending what i felt surprised me it was intense sadness even a moment of near despair that despite everything everyone around the world had endured and seen things would almost certainly soon go back to the way they had always been and that now that would be unbearable bashir mohamed do you even know what s happening right now in early may during the pandemic i thought about my father s death i remember my sister shaking me awake on the morning of august i thought it was nothing so i went back to sleep she shook me again but i fell asleep once more then she shook me harder with more urgency and said do you even know what s happening right now i went downstairs where the room was filled with paramedics and my dad lay on the floor he d had a heart attack my other memories of that day are scattered but i still recall the shock i felt when i realized he would not be coming back i frequently think about that day and try to remember my dad and how he shaped my life but so much time has passed i have forgotten the sound of his voice my dad was a worker at the meatpacking plant in brooks our family lived in edmonton and he would often be gone for months in somalia he had been an engineer but canada did not recognize his program or give him a simple path to recertification meatpacking was one of the few places in alberta that would accept a worker like him so he jumped at the chance the work was precarious and the management was notorious for caring more about the quality and output of the meat than the actual workers many in my position young refugees understand this reality and have a personal connection to these plants we know that nobody does this work out of choice they do it so their children can have a shot at different options in the future perhaps this is why the outbreak at the cargill and jbs meatpacking plants hits so close to home because to be frank the outbreak lays bare the position of racialized people in canada people like me some numbers early may alberta meatpacking plant employees make up more covid cases than the provinces of saskatchewan manitoba new brunswick pei and newfoundland combined the scale of this outbreak is no accident it speaks directly to a failure in government healthcare leadership and meatpacking plant management despite this one plant as of this writing remains open and another is already returning their employees to the danger within the plant after just two weeks being closed the lack of concern for these workers is disgusting it s clear this would never happen if most of the workforce were white to me covid has laid bare the inequalities in our society that hurts i am in the military on notice to move anywhere in canada during the pandemic the waiting is stressful but i m proud to be in a position where i can give back it s my duty i wish canadians could find their sense of duty to meatpacking plant workers it s shocking to see people who look like me who work where my dad worked treated in this country as if they are disposable trina moyles the use of fear the bear emerges from the willows a startle of black i stop bear there a halo of mosquitoes swarms his molting fur the willows bend break under his bulky heft i avoid his beady eyed stare hear his lifted snout snfff snfffff snffff i shouldn t be surprised to see him i work alone as a lookout observer at a remote fire tower in the peace country since april i ve encountered more bears than people but the fear of coming within metres of a pound predator is so powerful that it practically yanks me out of my skin i feel fragile incompetent a twig of a woman clutching a canister of bear spray everything i had been worrying about tasks undone friends uncalled life goals unfulfilled dinner unmade evaporates on the spot i m afraid of what s going to happen next it wasn t so different with covid in mid march i was supposed to travel to a book event in switzerland i have a bad feeling about this trina a friend told me he had been reading extensively about covid cases spreading into south korea iran and italy i don t think you should go i looked at him skeptically a week later italy s hospitals were overrun with patients death count rising the country went on lockdown i watched a video of italians singing from their balconies another of people warning the world please take this seriously i cancelled my plane ticket to switzerland words like quarantine and social distancing became a regular part of my vocabulary i obsessed over dr hinshaw s daily updates cautionary advice closures cancellations total cases in alberta rising total global cases skyrocketing even in a small northern town where social distancing is already something of a norm the streets emptied of people i couldn t sleep i d wake at a m my chest tight the sheets soaked i googled symptoms repeatedly total global death count rising did i have covid was i unknowingly infecting people far more vulnerable than my year old able bodied self my freelance writing contracts weren t impacted by covid but i struggled to make sense of my panicked thoughts word count i was afraid for the well being of my parents for friends living in cities across canada in new york city and sub saharan africa where some public health officials worried covid would tear across the continent like a wildfire terrified i watched the ucp s ruthless cuts to health education and environmental regulation i learned a new phrase disaster capitalism as the snow melted i packed up my belongings to fly out to the fire tower never been a better time to be a lookout my friends joked but it wasn t the physical isolation i craved rather it was the sense of normalcy i felt desperate for the knowing that when it s hot and dry there s fire the familiar chaos in the phenomenon of wildfire but beyond the black spruce the indirect chaos of covid ensues horrified i watch videos of a police suv running over protesters a white cop kneeling on the neck of a black man until his last breath i say his name george floyd i am reminded of my white privilege and that the fear felt by those living in brown and black bodies was infectious long before covid huff the bear stares hard at me my knees are shaking i m afraid because i know i m not in control of what happens next not entirely but fear isn t a useful survival tool not without action anyway i remember what the experts say carry bear spray remain six feet apart talk to the bear in a low calm voice wash your hands regularly back away slowly avoid travel outside of canada the bear ambles back into the woods i catch my breath again covid has made me reconsider who and what is sacred to me how can i transform my fear into positive action i climb my tower and watch for smoke i try to write

the night of dec they both were students at peru state at the time at keadle s trial in february prosecutors argued that it was first degree murder a planned intentional killing saying he had taken thomas out to a boat ramp early the morning she disappeared intending to kill her and dumped her body in the river the defense told jurors that the state wanted them to wildly speculate about what happened that night and that it was more likely that thomas fell in the river or jumped given that witnesses said she was very drunk and out of control that night in the end the jury found keadle guilty of second degree murder an intentional killing without premeditation at his sentencing last month keadle said he was sorry for the choices he made and feels responsible for thomas not being here but i did not kill tyler he said before he sentenced keadle to years to life in prison district judge ricky schreiner told keadle that his actions that night resulted in thomas losing her life

defendants the motion judge did not apply the appropriate standard of review notwithstanding this legal error we are satisfied that plaintiffs claims based on tortious interference and defamation cannot stand in his ruling dismissing her case the motion judge did not mention or otherwise refer to plaintiffs claim for negligent misrepresentation after conducting our own independent review of this issue we are compelled to reverse and remand for further consideration by the trial court of the claim based on negligent misrepresentation plaintiff began her employment at beach trading a k a beach camera on july in an unspecified management position beach trading is a family operation owned by raymond mosseri with albert mosseri as vice president and solomon mosseri as secretary treasurer on july albert mosseri sent a company wide e mail introducing plaintiff as the vice president of daily operations at an unspecified time albert mosseri asked plaintiff to oversee the customer service department temporarily during the christmas season it is undisputed that her title and salary were not changed as a result of this assignment when hizami began working at beach trading in october as a customer service representative plaintiff was working in the customer service department at a desk similar to the other customer service representatives she continued working in that department until she left the company in june on or about april plaintiff began looking for a new position outside beach trading she responded to an employment posting for a customer service representative at hrk kasindorf offered plaintiff the position of customer service manager because based on the professional experiences she listed on her resume he believed she might be overqualified for the position of customer service representative by letter dated june kasindorf confirmed plaintiffs acceptance of the customer service manager position commencing on june this letter also indicated that plaintiff was entitled to a sixty day severance package if she was terminated within the first year of employment there is a conflict in the record as to plaintiffs performance at hrk plaintiff claims that kasindorf had told her he was very pleased with her work as manager and he felt that everyone was doing a better job kasindorf on the other hand has indicated that he was dissatisfied with plaintiffs performance as a manager and claims that he advised plaintiff of his concerns memoranda written by kasindorf document incidents where plaintiff allegedly used poor judgment in resolving employee related conflicts according to kasindorf as his dissatisfaction with her management skills grew he began to question the validity of the representations plaintiff made in her resume finally in an effort to allay his concerns kasindorf decided to contact the customer service department of beach trading in order to verify the accuracy of plaintiffs professional experiences instead of forthrightly requesting that beach trading confirm or deny the employment history plaintiff had listed in her resume kasindorf decided to engage in a needless subterfuge misrepresenting both his identity and the true nature of his call kasindorfs memorandum dated june reveals his version of what transpired according to kasindorfs june memo he made additional calls to beach trading on june and each time confirming that plaintiff was a customer service representative at his deposition kasindorf admitted that he never asked to speak to albert mosseri or a corporate officer at beach trading about plaintiff although hizami recalled receiving phone calls from a prospective employer inquiring about plaintiff he could not recall any details about the calls according to his memo kasindorf terminated plaintiffs employment on june because she had been hired under fraudulent terms and she mis represented her previous position on her resume in contrast to these statements in his memo kasindorf testified in a deposition that he decided to fire plaintiff before calling beach trading he had planned to use the alleged misrepresentations however to invalidate plaintiffs contractual right to receive severance pay at his deposition kasindorf indicated that plaintiffs misrepresentation played a minor role in his decision to terminate her employment plaintiff contends however that kasindorf never mentioned that she was being terminated for poor performance his decision according to plaintiff was based exclusively on what beach trading had told him about her employment history at the time of her termination plaintiff had worked at hrk for less than two weeks her claim for sixty day severance pay was settled for in reviewing the dismissal of a complaint on summary judgment

j super a d app div certif denied n j a d plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in dismissing her negligent misrepresentation claim without evaluating the existence of issues of fact or making conclusions of law she contends that there are genuine issues of fact as to whether her employment was terminated because kasindorf believed she had misrepresented herself on her resume as she contends or based on poor performance as defendants contend we agree in both respects in the usual negligent misrepresentation case the plaintiff is the direct recipient of the statement alleged to have been negligently provided here although plaintiff was not the recipient of the misinformation we hold that she is nevertheless entitled to assert a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation because she falls within the class of individuals injured by its dissemination a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation may exist when a party negligently provides false information karu v feldman n j a d a negligent misrepresentation constitutes a n incorrect statement negligently made and justifiably relied on and may be the basis for recovery of damages for economic loss sustained as a consequence of that reliance mc clellan v feit n j super a d app div quoting h rosenblum inc v adler n j a d see also kaufman v i stat corp n j a d union ink co v at t corp n j super a d app div certif denied n j a d in order to determine whether any statements by defendants were negligently made it is necessary to determine whether defendants owed plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in communicating facts about her employment to prospective employers and if so whether communication of false information was a breach of that duty the determination of the existence of a duty is a question of law for the court petrillo v bachenberg n j a d sanchez v independent bus co n j super a d app div the supreme court has recently reaffirmed its holding in petrillo outlining the basic elements of the tort of negligent misrepresentation in the context of an attorneys duty to non clients thus under the banco popular petrillo paradigm the guiding principle for the imposition of liability is fairness to both the party making the representation and to the party aggrieved by its dissemination new jersey like many states has not determined whether an employer has an affirmative duty to respond to a reference inquiry see kiren dosanjh annotation former employers or supervisors tort liability to prospective employer or third person for misrepresentation or nondisclosure in employment reference a l r th employers who choose to respond to a reference inquiry however may be held liable for negligent misrepresentation based on misleading or incomplete statements made in employment references ibid no court in this state has addressed the issue of whether to hold an employer who chooses to respond to an inquiry liable for the tort of negligent misrepresentation in providing employment references most of the out of state cases have dealt with situations in which the prospective employer or third persons have suffered physical injury and the former employer failed to disclose violent tendencies or misrepresented the employees nature or character such questions are not at issue in this case see e g restatement second of torts randi w v muroc joint unified sch dist cal th cal rptr d p d writer of a letter of recommendation who failed to disclose disciplinary action taken against former employee for sexual misconduct held liable for negligent misrepresentation when student at school who hired employee was molested since risk of harm was a substantial foreseeable risk davis v bd of county commrs of dona ana county n m p d app employer who gave favorable recommendation for employee despite fact that employee had been investigated for allegedly sexually harassing female inmates owed a duty to prospective employers and foreseeable third parties not to make negligent misrepresentation of employees record when substantial risk of physical harm to third party foreseeable because the extension of liability to a former employer for negligently misrepresenting an employees position with the company with resulting economic loss has not been examined by new jersey courts we will evaluate other comparable legal standards for guidance the restatement second of torts is instructive in this situation it provides in relevant part that the cause of action for negligent misrepresentation causing economic losses as set forth in has been recognized by federal courts in new jersey see e g pub serv enter group inc v philadelphia elec co f supp d n j nuclear power plant owners claim against operating owner on theory of negligent misrepresentation as well as other tort and contract claims was sufficient to survive motion to dismiss because of disputed facts regarding the contract between the parties and questions of law regarding the defendants duty to the plaintiffs under the contract and common law somarelf v am bureau of shipping f supp d n j under maritime law plaintiffs ability to seek tort based indemnification from defendant for negligent misrepresentation and recovery is dependent upon resolution of material issues of fact as to reliance and the extent of economic loss pursuant to the restatement second of torts supra a plaintiff is a person or one of a limited group of persons for whose benefit and guidance the information is supplied thus if a jury determines that kasindorf told defendants that he was calling to verify plaintiffs employment defendants by voluntarily responding to the inquiry undertook the duty to exercise reasonable care or competence in its response to kasindorf ibid a jury determination that defendants voluntarily assumed a duty of care to plaintiff by responding to kasindorfs inquiry is only the first step in the process once this is done a jury must then determine whether defendants breached that duty this determination would depend upon resolution of the factual dispute regarding the nature of kasindorfs inquiry since a user of commercial information cannot reasonably expect its maker to have undertaken to satisfy this obligation unless the terms of the obligation were known to him restatement second of torts supra comment a here it is undisputed that when hizami started working at beach trading plaintiff was answering phones in the customer service department at a desk similar to the other customer service representatives and another employee actually had the title of customer service supervisor thus by way of defense defendants argue that hizamis statement although incorrect was not negligently made it was rather a logical inference drawn from the facts available to him this argument is undermined by kasindorfs memos in which he indicates that he spoke with several beach trading employees who repeated the same factually incorrect statement about plaintiffs employment status while at beach trading we reject however plaintiffs argument that under these circumstances the dissemination of a factually incorrect account of her employment history constitutes negligence per se based on the record before us there is a genuine factual dispute as to whether the other employees knew or should have known of plaintiffs actual title giving plaintiff the benefit of all facts and inferences on review of a dismissal of a claim on summary judgment we must accept as an established fact that kasindorf called beach trading to verify plaintiffs references and hizami gave kasindorf false information as to plaintiffs former position it is for a jury to determine whether defendants actions here were reasonable or amounted to negligent dissemination of false information the nature of the inquiry is also hotly disputed with respect to the kasindorf phone call hizami testified that he knew the caller was a prospective employer calling to verify plaintiffs employment history at beach trading this is of course contrary to defendants claim that hizami was innocently supplying a title to a customer calling to praise plaintiff for good service the record is silent as to the other employees kasindorf allegedly spoke to regarding plaintiff there is also a clear question of fact concerning whether hizami and or the other employees who may have spoken to kasindorf were acting within the scope of their employment thereby rendering beach trading potentially liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior conduct is generally considered to be within the scope of employment if it is of the kind that the servant is employed to perform it occurs substantially within the authorized time and space limits and it is actuated at least in part by a purpose to serve the master di cosala v kay n j a d quoting restatement second of agency from the record before us we have no way of knowing whether hizami and the other employees who may have spoken to kasindorf were authorized to respond to inquiries about former employees even those within their department this issue must be thoroughly explored before a court performing its gate keeping function in the context of deciding a summary judgment motion can permit a jury to impose liability upon an employer for disseminating inaccurate information about a former employees work history there is also a factual dispute concerning the reasons for kasindorfs decision to terminate plaintiffs employment it is undisputed that kasindorf advertised only for a customer service representative but hired plaintiff as a customer service manager based on the position she held with beach trading it is equally undisputed that kasindorf was not able to verify plaintiffs employment with beach trading until after she accepted the position with hrk because plaintiff asked him not to contact beach trading while she was still employed there plaintiff thus argues that it was reasonable for kasindorf to have called beach trading to verify her employment and to have relied on the accuracy of the information conveyed to him by beach trading defendants however argue that if kasindorf had been satisfied with plaintiffs performance he would have had no reason to verify her employment two weeks after hiring her to further complicate matters kasindorf testified that he had made the decision to fire plaintiff before calling beach trading and would have fired her regardless of what beach trading said about her previous position his own file memo however states that plaintiff was fired because she had been hired under fraudulent terms and she misrepresented her previous position on the resume on the other hand other memos do corroborate defendants claim that kasindorf was not satisfied with plaintiffs performance in this light it is a material disputed fact as to whether kasindorf actually relied on any statement made or whether he terminated plaintiff for poor performance the dispute is significant because if plaintiff was terminated exclusively for poor job performance she would not have suffered any economic loss as a result of a factually incorrect statement made by any defendant and the negligent misrepresentation cause of action must fail we therefore conclude that plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts with respect to her negligent misrepresentation cause of action to survive the summary judgment motion made specifically there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether kasindorf properly notified defendants of the nature and purpose of his inquiry which could subject defendants to a duty of reasonable care in any voluntary response once the decision was made to respond to the inquiry whether communicating the factually incorrect statement breached that duty whether kasindorf justifiably relied upon the factually incorrect statement in terminating plaintiffs employment and whether plaintiff suffered an economic loss as a result we are satisfied that the statement made by defendants is not actionable as a defamatory statement the standard of review here is de novo we are not obligated to defer to the trial courts legal rulings manalapan realty v manalapan tp comm n j a d defamation imposes liability for publication of false statements that injure the reputation of another printing mart morristown v sharp elec corp n j a d in order to prove defamation a plaintiff must establish in addition to damages that the defendant made a defamatory statement of fact concerning the plaintiff which was false and which was communicated to a person or persons other than the plaintiff feggans v billington n j super a d app div fault must also be proven ibid accord beck v tribert n j super a d app div certif denied n j a d in order to determine if a statement is reasonably susceptible of a defamatory meaning a court must scrutinize the language according to the fair and natural meaning which will be given it by reasonable persons of ordinary intelligence printing mart morristown supra n j at a d quoting romaine v kallinger n j a d indeed words that are not susceptible of any defamatory interpretation are not actionable and a cause of action will not lie for such statements printing mart morristown supra n j at a d in this light the words at issue here incorrectly reporting plaintiffs employment history are not susceptible of any defamatory meaning as a matter of law there is no evidence that defendants intended to cast plaintiff as a liar or as a person who would deliberately falsify information on her resume as a means of defrauding a potential employer finally plaintiff contends that she established a prima facie case for tortious interference with either her contractual relationship with hrk based on the june letter of employment and or the prospective economic advantage in continuing employment with hrk she again argues that summary judgment should not have been granted because of the factual dispute over the reason for her termination defendants counter that plaintiff has failed to produce any evidence that the interference was intentional and malicious we agree with defendants position a claim for tortious interference with a contract and or prospective business relationship requires a plaintiff to prove see also dello russo v nagel n j super a d app div in the tortious interference cause of action malice is defined to mean that the interference was inflicted intentionally and without justification or excuse di maria constr inc v interarch n j super a d app div affd n j a d malice is determined on an individualized basis and the standard used by the court must be flexible viewing the defendants actions in the context of the case presented ideal dairy farms inc v farmland dairy farms inc n j super a d app div certif denied n j a d here there is no evidence that hizami or the other employees intended to induce or cause kasindorf to

url540,irrelevant,charlotte against a backdrop of five days of protests charlottes police chief reversed his position saturday and decided to immediately release video footage of the fatal shooting of keith lamont scott the dashboard camera from an arriving police car shows officers surrounding scott s car scott exits and steps backwards away from the car his hands at his side at the second mark in the video as officers repeatedly yell drop the gun at the second mark shots are fired and scott falls to the ground as officers surround scott out of dashboard camera range at the mark an officer announces over the radio we got shots fired one suspect down the video ends at the second mark the shaky body cam video is minute seconds in length showing an officer circling scott s car the picture picks up on scott on the ground at seconds as an officer yells for handcuffs scott s handcuffed hands can be seen with blood and the sound of painful moaning can be heard an officer attending asks for medical equipment and says we need to hold the wound the video then stops a case update that accompanied the video provided the police report of the incident it stated that two plain clothes officers were sitting inside of their unmarked police car preparing to serve an arrest warrant when scott pulled up in his white suv more on the charlotte shooting the officers said scott rolled what they believed to be a marijuana blunt a short time later an officer observed scott hold a gun up due to the combination of illegal drugs and the gun mr scott had in his possession officers decided to take enforcement action for public safety concerns the report states officers departed to outfit themselves with marked duty vests and equipment that would clearly identify them as police officers upon returning the officers again witnessed scott in possession of a gun the officers immediately identified themselves as police officers and gave clear loud and repeated verbal commands to drop the gun mr scott refused to follow the officers repeated verbal commands the report states when another officer used his baton to breach the front passenger window scott exited while continuing to ignore officers repeated loud verbal commands to drop the gun according to the report officer brentley vinson the officer who fatally shot scott perceived mr scott s actions and movements as an imminent physical threat to himself and the other officers officer vinson fired his issued service weapon striking mr scott the report stated the report also featured pictures of the gun ankle holster and marijuana blunt in scotts possession justin bamberg one of the lawyers for the scott family said in a press conference directly after the video release that many questions need to be answered do those actions do those precious seconds justify this shooting that is the most important question said bamberg bamberg noted there was no definitive evidence of scott holding a gun adding he s not aggressively moving toward law enforcement officers he s doing the opposite he s passively stepping back ray dotch rakiya scott s brother said at the press conference that the family was delighted the videos were released for the goal of unfiltered truth unfortunately we are left with far more questions than we have answers said dotch it does not make sense to us how this incident resulted in the loss of life and it s not clear in the videos that were released dotch said that reports of scotts character should not factor into the investigation we shouldn t have to humanize him in order for him to be treated fairly said dotch what we know and what you should know about him is that he was an american citizen who deserved better authorities previously declined to release the footage arguing it could jeopardize the integrity of the investigation of tuesdays shooting that has been taken over by the state bureau of investigation charlotte police chief kerr putney told reporters at a news conference that he no longer had those concerns the fatal encounter was captured by police dash cameras and body cameras but authorities as well as the scott family said it is inconclusive regarding how events unfolded putney emphasized he was not swayed by the protests or the release friday of dramatic cell phone video of the shooting made by scotts wife north carolina gov pat mc crory said in a statement that he agreed with the decision to release the footage asked if the video that will be released shows the year old scott a father of seven pointing a weapon at officers putney reiterated that it alone does not there is no definitive visual evidence that he had a gun in his hand you see something in the hand and that he pointed it at an officer putney said but what we do see is compelling evidence when you put all the pieces together that support that putney also indicated the officers who had gone to the apartment complex where the shooting occurred to serve a warrant observed scott who was in his vehicle breaking the law by having marijuana in his possession when according to the police scott produced a weapon the officers drew theirs there was a crime that he had committed that caused the encounter he said and the gun exacerbated that situation putney also said his officers didn t break the law but noted the state bureau of investigation is continuing its investigation officers are absolutely not being charged by me but again there s another investigation ongoing he said in the harrowing family video taken by scotts wife rakeyia she is heard trying to convince police not to shoot her husband while it does not show the fatal shooting itself it is punctuated with shouts by police to keith scott to drop his gun and is followed by four shots in rapid succession in the fatal shooting during the two minute video released friday rakeyia scott near hysteria can be heard shouting dont you shoot him the scott family and some neighborhood witnesses claimed scott did not have a gun but was sitting in his car reading a book while awaiting the arrival of his son on a school bus when police approached police rejected that claim saying he was armed and that his weapon was confiscated at the scene earlier saturday several hundred people carrying signs and chanting slogans gathered under a hot afternoon sun in a park in central charlotte on the fifth day of demonstrations demanding the release of police video showing the fatal shooting of keith lamont scott some wore shirts reading black lives matter and support the charlotte movement while others milled around a makeshift stage awaiting speakers the crowd included people handing out bottles of water in the degree heat two women offered to register people to vote among protesters gathering beside a large oak tree in marshall park was temako mc carthy whose son died in after being hit with a taser by a charlotte mecklenburg police officer a federal civil jury later determined the officer used excessive force at a rally of civic groups rev corine mack president of the charlotte chapter of the naacp said groups of activists and members of the local clergy have been meeting with the mayor and city council daily pleading to release the tape pleading for transparency pleading to get it right since that time we have decided we wont stop and we cant stop she said addressing the crowd with members of the clergy behind her she said the group drawn from many faiths and ethnic backgrounds has been working since the day of the shooting to try to head off violence the clergy every day and every night have been on the street marching talking loving and ensuring that each and every person wold go home safely she said the citizens as well as the police charlotte is the latest u s city to be shaken by protests and recriminations over the death of a black man at the hands of police a list that includes baltimore milwaukee chicago new york and ferguson mo this is at best gross mishandling of a crime scene or at worst a cover up and a conspiracy there is anger unrest in our city which is legitimate rev milton alexander williams jr of walls memorial ame zion church said at saturdays rally in charlotte encouraging a peaceful protest demonstrators angry over the shooting marched friday evening for the fourth night in a row but the protests were largely peaceful

below regarding a press release for the arrests of christopher c crimaldi of mc henry drug induced homicide and delivery of a controlled substance jermal a johnson of waukegan drug induced homicide a few weeks ago there was a speed change on green st we don t know if anyone heard during the commotion the question of pedestrian laws requirements came about with the new crosswalks on green st along with all other crosswalks in town believe it or not pedestrians don t always have the right of way the roadway is meant for vehicular traffic with designated crossings for pedestrians here is a description of how vehicles and pedestrians must act in relation to each other on or near the roadway at the bottom you will find a link to the illinois compiled statute as it pertains to this question this is mainly taken straight from illinois law but it s pretty easy to read first driver s responsibilities ilcs vehicles entering stop crosswalk where stop signs or flashing signals are in place at an intersection or flashing red signals are in place at a plainly marked crosswalk between intersections a drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk and pedestrians within or entering the crosswalk at either edge of the roadway shall have the right of way over vehicles so stopped b drivers of vehicles having so yielded the right of way to pedestrians entering or within the nearest crosswalk at an intersection shall also yield the right of way to pedestrians within any other crosswalk at the intersection drivers behind the first stopped vehicle shall not attempt to pass the first stopped vehicle pretty simple right if a pedestrian is in the crosswalk and hasn t jumped out in from of a car you must yield second pedestrian responsibilities ilcs thru pedestrians rights and duties a pedestrian shall obey the instructions of any official traffic control device specifically applicable to him unless otherwise directed by a police officer when traffic control signals are not in place or not in operation a the driver of a vehicle shall stop and yield the right of way to a pedestrian crossing the roadway within a crosswalk when the pedestrian is upon the half of the roadway upon which the vehicle is traveling b or when the pedestrian is approaching so closely from the opposite half of the roadway as to be in danger no pedestrian shall suddenly leave a curb or other place of safety and walk or run into the path of a moving vehicle which is so close as to constitute an immediate hazard this is where pedestrians get it wrong pedestrians don t have the right of way no matter what crossing at other than crosswalks every pedestrian crossing a roadway at any point other than within a marked crosswalk or within an unmarked crosswalk at an intersection shall yield the right of way to all vehicles upon the roadway between adjacent intersections at which traffic control signals are in operation pedestrians shall not cross at any place except in a marked crosswalk meaning walk to the intersection and cross there no pedestrian shall cross a roadway intersection diagonally unless authorized by official traffic control devices or police officer pedestrians with disabilities may cross a roadway at any point other than within a marked crosswalk or within an unmarked crosswalk where the intersection is physically inaccessible to them but they shall yield the right of way to all vehicles upon the roadway ilcs pedestrians walking on the roadway if there is a sidewalk available pedestrians must use it where a sidewalk is not available pedestrians must walk as far as practicable off the roadway on the shoulder if no sidewalk or shoulder are available pedestrians must walk as far as practicable to the edge of the roadway and walk to of the left side of the road against traffic pedestrians must yield to all vehicular traffic come on out to the sunshine rotary oktoberfest theyre selling a wayne span of raffle tickets

url606,irrelevant,it was mid march and canadians had not quite realized how serious a problem covid was about to become for our country and for the world at large in shaphia taplins life any rumblings about the novel coronavirus were eclipsed by the devastating loss of her friend shannon fleming to diabetes at the age of just when fleming was waked at cauls funeral home in st johns on march it had been only days since the first local transmission of covid in canada and that had occurred on the other side of the country in vancouver there were not yet any public health guidelines in place for the prevention of covid in newfoundland and labrador bars and restaurants were open and weddings and funerals were going ahead as planned someone who came to pay their respects to fleming or to ed tobin who was being waked next door had just returned from out of province and unbeknownst to themselves was carrying the virus that weekend became a major transmission event one of the first in the country with cases of covid traced back to it when news of the cluster broke the finger pointing began taplin and other mourners were accused of being reckless of acting irresponsibly although theyd broken no regulations or guidelines despite the fact that taplin self isolated for days and ultimately tested negative for covid she became the target of abuse twice taplins neighbours called the police on her because they spotted her outside her home performing tasks on her own property like cleaning out her car we have an impulse to blame people for getting sick in ancient mesopotamia the region of modern day iraq illness was taken as a sign of having angered a god it wasnt because mesopotamians were ignorant of medicine mesopotamian doctors prescribed pharmaceuticals stitched wounds set bones and performed basic surgeries since mesopotamians believed the world was part of the divine order though every natural event reflected the will of the gods in medieval europe disease was seen as a product of humanitys sinfulness if not a punishment for individual wrongdoing it was at least a cosmic penalty for having eaten the forbidden fruit and fallen from grace some europeans believed the black death itself was a blight sent from god to annihilate the wicked we might like to think our society has moved past these ideas since the advent of germ theory but we still moralize disease the modern worlds epitome of a stigmatized illness is aids hiv the virus that causes aids probably crossed over from chimpanzees to humans in the s but it didnt gain much public attention until that year the cdc identified five gay men in los angeles who had contracted a rare lung infection at the same time some gay men in new york and california were being diagnosed with an unusual form of aggressive skin cancer watch see the cbc documentary the death of ray condon about a labrador man who spent his final months tackling stigma about aids neither disease normally affected people with robust immune systems which led researchers to the theory that the men were suffering from some condition that was weakening their immune response at first health officials referred to this new disease as gay related immune deficiency or grid as weve seen in our pandemic with politicians like trump insisting on calling covid the china virus naming an illness after an ethnicity or an oppressed minority only serves to reinforce bigotry it implies that a certain group of people is responsible for a disease or that only certain people can transmit a disease dangerously naming an illness this way can also give the impression that only certain people are vulnerable to a disease that was surely the case with hiv which remained a gay plague in the public consciousness for years even though the cdc had discovered by that it was a blood borne virus that could be passed to anyone through the sharing of body fluids for many straight people hiv and aids bolstered their pre existing prejudices and became another reason to avoid and disdain people who were lgbtq hiv was interpreted as proof that gay sex was riskier than straight sex or even that gay relationships were cursed by god all the while members of the gay community were suffering and dying from a devastating illness this widespread public condemnation though became the crucible in which the modern gay rights movement was forged hiv made gay men more publicly visible they could no longer be ignored the stigma that surrounded hiv in the s and persists to a lesser extent to this day shows us that our culture still hangs on to the idea that a sick person must have done something wrong instead of chalking up disease to a punishment from the gods we believe that someone whos been infected with an illness must have engaged in risky behaviour be it having gay sex or failing to physically distance listen andrew and ainsley hawthorn host the latest instalment of their apocalypse then feature on the st johns morning show its not always possible however to comply with the absolute safest health practices either because officials are still learning about a disease were hampered by structural factors like racism and disability or doing so would excessively lower our quality of life its unreasonable to expect an adult for instance to permanently abstain from sex though thats the only foolproof way to avoid catching sexually transmitted infections its also possible to do everything right to the best of your ability and still catch a disease in the end laying blame for an illness on its victim only disincentivizes people who are sick from getting diagnosed or seeking help when they need it read more from cbc newfoundland and labrador ainsley hawthorn ph d is a cultural historian
