However, due to high volume, staff cannot guarantee that all messages will receive replies.\nAccommodations. Reasonable accommodations will be made for any student with a qualifying disability. Such requests should be made through the Disabled Students Program (DSP). More information, instructions on how to access accommodations, and information on related resources can be found on the DSP website. Note: in this class there are no timed assessments.\nLetter grades. Letter grades are assigned based only on the assessments identified above and according to university guidelines, with the relative weighting of assessments determined at the discretion of the instructor. While grade calculations will not be disclosed, students are entitled to an explanation of the criteria used to determine their grades if desired. Grades will not be changed except in the case of clerical errors. If students feel their grade has been unfairly assigned, they are entitled to contest it following UCSB procedure for contesting grades.\nConduct. All course participants are expected to maintain respectful and honorable conduct consistent with UCSB ethical standards. Students uncomfortable with the behavior of another course participant for any reason should notify the instructor, course staff, or, if the complaint relates to course staff conduct, an administrative or departmental officer. Evidence of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct (OSC); evidence of problematic behavior will be addressed on a case-by-case basis in accord with university policies."

    "text": "No particular ability or skill defines success in data science. Data science involves a combination of computing, statistics and probability, and domain expertise. It also involves the use of technology and the practice of narrative communication and storytelling. You can probably think of one or two other aspects of the discipline to add to the list. Emerging curricula in data science seek to balance core competencies across these or similar areas. (Perhaps this is the present hallmark of the discipline.) Yet, no one person can expect to be an expert in all of these areas, and even core competencies across component areas can look a bit different from person to person among perfectly qualified data scientists. We should all accept that we have strengths and weaknesses and resist the temptation to idealize: that is, to associate a particular constellation – whether that’s our own, the opposite of our own, or another idea idea we have – of abilities with ‘better’ data science. If we can know our own balance of skills (and interests), be open to healthy challenges, and focus on what we can do well and how we can improve, that is enough."
