In a KG, the objects and concepts are represented as nodes, while their relations are represented as edges of the graph. Due to the graph structure of this knowledge representation, a KG can be a potent mechanism for searching entities and their relations, discovering new information and enabling complex decision making.\n\n\n\nFigure: Left, example knowledge graph with three entity types and two relations. Right, summary of example relations for possible entity type pairs.\n\n\nThe process of updating and expanding a KG can be manual and laborious and require ongoing collaboration with subject matter experts. Natural language processing (NLP) and text-mining algorithms could streamline this process by automatically extracting essential information about objects, concepts, and their relations. Once deployed, these algorithms could populate nodes and edges of a KG in an automated fashion based on incoming data.\nTwo crucial processes in generating nodes and edges of the KG are Named Entity Recognition and Linking (NER/NEL) and Relation Extraction (RE). NER/NEL automatically analyzes free text to recognize character substrings that identify entities of interest, while RE identifies entity pairs with certain relations.\nAs NER/NEL and RE are necessary steps in generating nodes and edges of the KG, it is critically important that these algorithms accurately extract entities and their relations from free text. To quantify performance of NER/NEL and RE, benchmarking datasets are often used. The entity and relation labels in these datasets are either annotated manually by subject matter experts or algorithmically using semi-supervised and/or rule-based approaches.\nThe focus of this project lies in identifying open-source NER/NEL and RE algorithms that show the highest performance in recognizing such entities as “company”, “molecule”, “protein” and their relations. A critical aspect of the work will be in generating a benchmarking dataset using publicly available data.",

If the customer has integrated their bank account with Plaid (third-party provider) in APM, we also have data coming directly from their bank transactions.\nCustomers have been telling us that they would appreciate it if they could detect anomalies in their records and transaction history. For example, they would like to know if the water bill is much more expensive than the previous months for one property, since that would likely indicate a problem. They would also appreciate knowing if there’s a bill that usually comes but it doesn’t. This is a general problem with applications in multiple areas inside our software, and so we would like to have a way of detecting anomalies automatically so that property managers don’t have to worry about every single detail for each property.\nFor this project, students will analyze outlier detection methods, performance evaluation metrics for empirical comparisons between methods, and assess the methods from an explainability perspective. Students will develop comprehensive method comparisons and integrate them in a dashboard to present them with the correct data visualization techniques.",

Mortality is incredibly high (often upwards of 99%) for most fishes during the larval stage but because larvae are so abundant small changes in rates of survival result in orders of magnitude difference in survival to adult stages (i.e., recruitment). For this reason, elucidating the actual mechanisms in the ocean that affect larval survival is an integral component of fisheries management. Yet, despite over a century of recruitment research, accurately estimating these parameters has been difficult and predicting conditions that facilitate larval survival and drive recruitment remains the fundamental challenge in fisheries science and management.\nCalCOFI data include physical, environmental, and biological measurements collected from water samples and tows from ship cruises conducted quarterly since ~1950. Measurements are: (i) georeferenced – taken at recorded spatial coordinates; (ii) longitudinal – taken repeatedly over time; (iii) profiled – recorded across depth in the water column; and (iv) multivariate. The complexity of the datasets due to these attributes presents both promise for discovery and challenges for data analysis and display.\nThis project will aim to ascertain predictive relationships between environmental and biological systems. Focus on the relationship between environmental DNA and fish larvae is anticipated, but students will have some latitude to shape the direction of their work and may utilize secondary datasets as appropriate to the overall project aim. The primary objectives for this project will be: (i) developing interactive data displays effective for exploratory analysis and communication; and (ii) applying statistical methodology for prediction of variables of interest. Students will work primarily in R with version control.",

And insurance carriers would adjust the premium based on how much risk a business has. Risk can refer to the likelihood of a loss, and the severity of a potential loss.\nInsurance carriers are particularly interested in detecting businesses in “risky” industries or detecting risks in businesses. We have defined three risk groups of interest, “explosive”, “entertainment”, and “traffic”. If a business has one or more characteristics in the table attached in the appendix, it is categorized in related risk groups.\nCarpe Data is hoping to improve its current flagging methodology for businesses with risky behavior through the creation of a machine learning model that will categorize businesses into risk groups (defined below). The model will utilize different business information such as its name, industries, and social media data points (i.e. textual reviews, images, etc.) to help label businesses that fall into the “Entertainment” or “Traffic” risk groups. Note that these groups are NOT mutually exclusive and businesses may overlap with each other.\nFor this project, students will apply new NLP techniques and ML methods to label businesses according to risk groups. Students will validate their approach using manually labeled data and compare their approach with Carpe Data’s current classification method.",

Humans have some of the highest acuity in the animal kingdom, so we live in a perceptual world that is rich in spatial detail. Acuity, however, is highly variable, varying by at least four orders of magnitude across animals, meaning that the majority of animals cannot resolve as much spatial detail as we do. Despite acuity’s ecological importance, however, we know little about why this variation exists, and one unanswered question in most animal groups is whether there aspects of a species’ ecology that correlate with variation in acuity. This project will leverage high resolution photographs taken by the NSF-funded Big Bee Project (http://big-bee.net) to estimate acuity bees. Bees are an excellent group in which to examine variation in acuity, because they exhibit a wide range of lifestyles and ecologies. To measure acuity from a photograph, we must measure two parameters: the diameter of the hexagonal facets (ommatidia) that comprise the bee’s compound eye, and the eye’s radius of curvature.\nFor this project, students will begin with a set of images from approximately 50 species of bees. For each species, several photographs are available that view the bee from different angles. Students will use this dataset to develop algorithms for estimating the diameter of ommatidia and radius of curvature from a photograph. Students will use estimates to calculate acuity. If time permits, the project will explore potential correlates of acuity among aspects of bee ecology, for example nocturnality/diurnality, living socially or solitarily, and sex differentiation.",

In these regions, precipitation (PPT), or rainfall, is a critical indicator of vegetative health and success, and so a number of methods have been developed for expressing the quantity and quality of rainfall. In addition to the amount of PPT coming into the system, there has also been increasing attention on the atmospheric demand for water. One way of capturing this is the use of potential evapotranspiration (PET), which combines temperature, humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed to estimate the amount of water which would be soaked up by the atmosphere over a given surface. Many indicators have sought to combine these factors in a meaningful way to identify deficits in available water for vegetation, and anticipate food shortages in the developing world.\nHowever, PPT and PET are inversely related. The factors associated with rainfall (cloud cover, high humidity, latent cooling) also lead to low PET. This capstone project seeks to explore the relationship between PPT and PET in space and time. Where these factors are tightly coupled, drought events would be accompanied by increased PET, and lead to larger water deficits than might be indicated by precipitation alone. Where the relationship is less coupled, there may be independent factors driving the PET, and we will seek to understand the drivers of that independent component.\nThis project will work with quasi-global grids of PPT and PET from the last 40 years to explore these relationships, potentially identify drivers of both PPT and the independent component of PET, and maybe even explore developing statistical forecasts of these factors based on sea surface temperatures.\n\n\n\nEvaluating and validating stations and satellite based daily precipitation dataset\nStudent team: Lily Li, Changhee Yoon, Hannah Li, Russell Liu, Fei Du\nProject advisors: Shrad Shukla, Greg Husak, Enbo Zhou\nDaily precipitation is critical for monitoring climate hazards such as floods and droughts, and for running hydrologic and crop water balance models that provide estimates of available water to better manage and utilize water resources. The Climate Hazards Center (CHC) is a global leader in generating precipitation dataset based on satellites and on ground stations. The dataset is called CHIRPS, which stands for Climate Hazards Center InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) and is a gridded dataset that covers the entire globe, at a spatial resolution of 5km X 5km. CHIRPS version 2.0 has been widely used globally, for monitoring climate hazards and for understanding long-term changes in precipitation.\nCHC currently is in the process of developing the latest version of this dataset which is CHIRPS 3.0. The goal of this project is to evaluate the daily precipitation values from this dataset. The evaluation process will involve downloading and processing several independent precipitation datasets that come from diverse sources, to compare them with CHIRPS 3.0, and advanced statistical methods to quantify the performance of the daily CHIRPS 3.0 dataset relative to other datasets. The results of this analysis will be documented and submitted for a peer-reviewed publication.",

Decades of animal behavior research into this question has identified several tactics animals may use. However, most studies do not realistically replicate the problem competing animals face in nature. For example, most experimental studies stage contests between two individuals over one resource; in reality, animals likely interact with a population of multiple competitors, all fighting over multiple resources. Understanding how animals fight in these more naturalistic scenarios will help us discover the strategies animals use in natural systems, while reaffirming or contesting the conclusions of previous work.\nThis study intends to track how a population of individuals compete over multiple resources by studying contests in mantis shrimp, crustaceans that use spring-powered strikes during fights over access to protective burrows. Specifically, we will set up “mesocosms”, large areas holding multiple, individually-marked mantis shrimp and multiple burrows. By tracking each individual over weeks to months, we can see who fights with whom, what their contests are like (e.g., how aggressive), and who ends up holding which resource(s).\nThe primary objectives of this project will be to build methods to track uniquely-marked individuals from video recordings, and to identify timestamps in videos when two individuals come into contact (perhaps leading to a fight). Finally, an additional goal of this project will be to gather movement and residence data from each individual—identifying how much individuals move through their environment and which resource(s) they ultimately hold. The methods from this project will form the basis for a long-term project that modifies this approach for multiple experiments in the future.",

However, despite continued investment in both of these practices, the understanding of relationships between human performance data and on-court productivity has not yielded the expected return. As a field, our understanding of the physical traits that comprise a competent NBA athlete is limited by a lack of consistent data collection processes, team staff churn, the inherent complexity of studying the human body, and the diversity of player roles in basketball.\nBeginning in 2013, P3 (Peak Performance Project) began collecting biomechanical data on professional and collegiate basketball players performing ballistic movements in their laboratories. As it currently stands, P3 owns the largest biomechanics database on NBA athletes in the world. This dataset comprises 3D Motion Capture and Force Plate data – allowing P3 to create skeletal models of their athletes for in-depth movement analysis. While many of P3’s efforts to date have involved studying injury-risk and training adaptations within this cohort, the extent to which this data can help inform which physical tools are important in today’s NBA landscape remains largely unknown.\nP3’s in-house dataset consists of 3D Motion Capture and Force Plate data conducted on professional and collegiate basketball players – approximately 1300 assessments in total. This data has been collected on a series of vertical plane (jumps) and lateral plane (lateral acceleration drills) actions in P3 labs in Atlanta, GA and Santa Barbara, CA. In addition to P3’s in-house data, scraping publicly available basketball data web will be integral to project success.\n\nFor this project, students will build a web-scraping tool for the purposes of comparing P3’s in-house data with on-court production at the professional and collegiate levels, build ML models to understand links between biomechanics data and on-court production, and develop an R Shiny application to visualize relationships between P3 data and on-court performance.",

All the larvae and almost all of the catches occurred within the Southern California bight which might suggest some spatial relations.\nThe team will explore the data in more depth, also looking at other species and timeframes.\nClimate change and young fish: the relationship between pH and aspects of larval fish assemblage in the California current\nStudent team: Cristian Razo, Robin Hollingsworth, and Jay Patwardhan\nAdvisors: Erin Satterthwaite, Chau Tran, and Sang-Yun Oh\nThis project looks for correlations between the water characteristics of multiple coastal regions and the makeup of the marine life there, with hopes of providing insight to future observations on what the makeup of marine life should be. This can be vital to preserving the environment, helping endangered marine species, and ensuring the well health of our oceans in general as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYoung fish\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFish larvae\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team has access to two large time-series datasets. The first is a large collection of water characteristics across many regions and depths of California’s coast from 2008-1015. The second is an even larger data set comprising the topology and makeup of many species of California marine life from 1904 to the present. Given the disparity in time-steps, the water characteristic data set requires backward forecasts that accurately predict water temperature and salinity.\nIn addition to correlations between the makeup of water and how these characteristics affect the current and future states of how marine life, the team is also exploring the various causal factors for water characteristics that vary from region to region, which in turn affects the makeup of marine life.",

There are two objectives. The first is to build a binary classifier to predict whether a webpage contains a criminal record or not. The second objective is to provide information about the arrest (e.g arrest date). The team aims to extract the date of the arrest and the arrest code.\nSome similar projects have already been put into production, with text mining algorithms generally supplemented with manual validation and checking to ensure data mining quality.

Much of the current technology is centered around RGB cameras as seen in Figure 1.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: RGB Sensing\n\n\nWhile RGB sensing is a de facto standard in real time object detection models it is not without its weaknesses and must be used in conjunction with other sensing technology to provide reliably safe object detection for autonomous driving.\nFigure 2 depicts a scene behind the lens of an RGB sensor on the left and the object detection of a thermal sensor on the right. RGB sensing tends to fail at night due to the reduced color space, which poses a large risk for the safety of autonomous driving cars. FLIR as a company specializes in the design and production of thermal imaging cameras, components, and imaging sensors, and hopes to leverage that technology in the field of computer vision.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: comparison of RGB sensing (left) and thermal sensing (right) for identical night scenes.\n\n\nThis project is primarily concerned with analyzing the robustness of a thermal object detector for ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) subject to the effect of added noise. Understanding the effect of noise is incredibly important to the field of computer vision. It has been observed that small amounts of noise can result in severe misclassifications.

Every year for 10 years, more than 100 variables are measured for each family member using surveys, physical exams, lab tests, and wearable activity monitors. The information that families contribute are then placed in a database about Latino health, behavior, lifestyle, and environment. Based on the data, Mil Familias plans to intervene in the areas of education, prevention, technology, policy, treatment, and more.\nThis project asks, which factors out of biology, behavior, psychology, society/environment are causing the highest amount of disproportionate burden in the Latino/Latina community of type 2 diabetes in mild (&gt;7%) and severe (&gt;9%) cases respectively?",

Once the committee has obtained a final pool of potential candidates, students will be selected from that pool by random lottery.\nIs there a GPA requirement?\nYour GPA does contribute in determining eligibility to participate (a higher GPA corresponds to a better academic record), but there is not a hard cutoff.\nWhat happens if I am waitlisted?\nIf you are waitlisted, that means that you met all requirements to join the class but were ultimately not chosen in the random lottery. If so, you will be considered for any seats that open up before the start of the quarter; selection for these seats is also carried out by random lottery.\nAre there any specific languages/packages I need to know?\nNo. The requirement is that you have intermediate proficiency (use in 2+ courses or equivalent) in some language so that you are familiar with programming concepts and able to learn further skills semi-independently (i.e., with the help of a book or tutorial). Most students will have had some experience with R or Python, and some with similar languages such as Matlab, Mathematica, or Julia. However, what constitutes ‘experience’ is pretty broad, and can range from a few courses to a few years of use. Regardless of experience, almost everyone will develop new programming skills ‘on-the-job’ in the course of their projects. All projects are different and students do not need a specific background to succeed.\nAre there any recommended classes that would prepare me for the capstone?\nCMPSC 5A-B and PSTAT 100 are widely accessible data science courses that can be taken in sequence over the course of a year and generally will provide good preparation for the capstone and exposure to programming in Python. PSTAT students may elect to take the statistical learning course (PSTAT 131) for additional preparation. Non-PSTAT majors would benefit from any quantitative methods courses offered in their home department. More broadly, any course(s) that reinforce programming skills and data analysis will be beneficial.\nHow are students assigned to capstone projects in the program?\nStudents have the opportunity to review proposed project abstracts and specify a set of preferred assignments. Preferences are considered together with technical skills, domain backgrounds, and factors affecting group dynamics in forming project teams, so we cannot guarantee students will receive their top choices. Ultimately, project assignments are made at the discretion of instructors.\nWill I get a job or internship through the program if my project is successful?\nThis is not guaranteed. Project sponsors’ commitments conclude at the end of the academic year. In some instances, sponsors have the resources and interest to support summer interns or entry-level hires, but this is entirely at their discretion. We have had students recruited in the past this way, but they comprise a minority of all program participants.",

The primary objectives of this project are to quantify the benefits that our Allthenticate’s security product provides and identifying opportunities to improve the Allthenticate user experience.\nFirst, we want to quantify how much of an improvement Allthenticate’s security solution provides over existing solutions. This includes tasks such as measuring time saved by using Allthenticate, tracking changes in Bluetooth connection, and monitoring app status. We will analyze the user data provided by the logs from readers, as well as the phone and computer apps. Second, we intend to increase how well the product is working. Allthenticate is constantly improving, and with user-happiness being at the core of the company’s values, we want to cater the best experience for the user. An example of this could be predicting a user’s app behaviors to personalize their UI to give them the most seamless experience for their particular needs.\nUsing preliminary product data, we developed a visualization dashboard for real-time monitoring of a client’s system activity.",

The documentary reveals the downsides of the major social media platforms. The goal of this project is to analyze the impact of The Social Dilemma on its audience’s attitudes towards social media. Does watching this movie increase/decrease/not change people’s social media usage?\nTo answer this question, we performed a series of statistical analyses on user-generated posts from Twitter and Reddit. Although our study reveals a difference in the user behavior patterns between the two platforms, the statistical results suggest that, based on the social media data, the movie did not change people’s social media usage.",

Under the guidance of Kelly Caylor (Director of ERI and WAVES lab), we are undertaking a project to explore how center pivot-irrigated agriculture is expanding globally. We’re interested in mapping these dynamics over the recent years and monitoring them going forward.\nSee our project poster here.",

Daza and Alex Franks\nUsing wearable, survey, and biomedical data from healthcare workers measured during the pandemic, we aim to identify variables indicative of stress such as sleep patterns, heart rate, PTSD, etc. We hope that our findings will give insights into how wearable technology can help detect stress in this population.\nThe features we used primarily came from wearable and survey data such as the Oura Ring, Daily Stress Measure, PTSD, Adverse Childhood Events (ACE), and Demographics datasets that were provided from Synapse database. We built two models: a mixed effects model that accounts for subject-specific baseline stress levels in predicting excess stress; and a logistic regression that identifies population-level indicators of stress.\n\n\n\nWearables Predict Stress in Frontline Healthcare Workers\nStudent team: Joshua Alvarado, Ian Gascon, Joanne Kim, Mac Kul, and Jessica Nguyen\nProject advisors: Julio Vega and Alex Franks\nWe are using data collected in “The Stress and Recovery in Frontline COVID-19 Health Care Workers Study.” Daily notifications prompted 365 participants to complete tasks through a REDCap study app including a Demographic Survey and a Daily Stress Measure and Work Shift Details survey.\nOur project objectives are twofold: identifying the main factors of stress (duration of sleep in different stages, heart rate, respiratory rate, and levels of oxygen saturation); and predicting whether a participant is stressed given those factors.\nSee our project poster here",

Our primary dataset consists of companies’ product quality ratings across the United States over a span of 20 years, ranging from 2001 to the present. Two of the main features we used are ‘signal score,’ which is a 1-3 score of how recently the product was observed, and ‘intensity’ which is a measure of how much a product is observed over time.",

Through the use of statistical methods we are aiming to compare differences in gene expression between control and mutant brain organoids. In addition we aim to identify cell populations that are more or less abundant in the mutant brain organoids. Thus, we are aiming to gain insight in disease mechanisms that lead to neurodegeneration.",
