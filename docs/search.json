    "text": "Tips for success\nWe have found that successful projects include students in making novel contributions to a broader research agenda based on concrete starting points. In other words, projects tend to be productive when there is a clear focus and purpose. In our view, mutually beneficial success is most likely when advisors:\n\nare invested in students’ intellectual and professional development;\nhave identified a well-defined data science problem of clear value to their agenda or organization;\ncan provide initial work (analysis, codes, relevant literature) and hands-on direction and training to students at the beginning of the project to facilitate a quick start.\n\nProjects tend to be less productive in the absence of very specific direction and engagement on the part of the advisor at the outset of the project – this often results in protracted exploratory analyses lacking focus. Typically, given the proper initial support, students are able to make ongoing progress with a fair degree of autonomy after a few weeks.",

Any such agreements are binding on students and faculty as university representatives.\nIn the 2025-2026 academic year, we will be providing a standard nondisclosure agreement on request. We are happy to consider modifications to the standard agreement provided they are not overly restrictive – students will need to discuss their work with the class and prepare a public poster presentation in order to earn university credit. It should be noted that the university cannot enter into agreements pertaining to ownership of project deliverables – students retain rights to work that they produce for academic credit.",

It is equally suitable for students interested in entering the job market as it is for those considering graduate school – we partner with both industry and academic project advisors to offer research experiences spanning a breadth of application domains!\nFor participating students, the capstone is a year-long course sequence comprising two distinct portions: a preparatory course in data science topics and collaborative research skills (PSTAT197A/CMPSC190DD, offered Fall term) and two experiential learning courses in which students work in teams on interdisciplinary projects sponsored by an external partner and advised by a technical specialist (PSTAT197B-C/CMPSC190DE-DF, offered Winter and Spring terms). The course sequence culminates with a public showcase of student work.\nFor participating project advisors, the program offers opportunities to engage in mentorship, advance research agendas, and establish collaborative partnerships."
