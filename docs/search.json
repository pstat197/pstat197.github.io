Students are responsible for material discussed in their absence and should review posted session notes and consult a classmate.\nDeadlines. Students are expected to meet assignment deadlines in a timely manner. All deadlines have a 24-hour grace period. Late or amended work may not be accepted.\nEmail. Course staff will make their best effort to reply to email within 48 weekday hours. However, due to high volume, staff cannot guarantee that all messages will receive replies.\nIllness. Students who are ill are required to stay home. Students ill with COVID-19 must comply with university policy regarding reporting and quarantine. Accommodations will be made to ensure that students absent due to illness do not fall behind.\nAccommodations. Reasonable accommodations will be made for any student with a qualifying disability. Such requests should be made through the Disabled Students Program (DSP). More information, instructions on how to access accommodations, and information on related resources can be found on the DSP website. Note: in this class there are no timed assessments.\nLetter grades. Letter grades are assigned based only on the assessments identified above and according to university guidelines, with the relative weighting of assessments determined at the discretion of the instructor. While grade calculations will not be disclosed, students are entitled to an explanation of the criteria used to determine their grades if desired. Grades will not be changed except in the case of clerical errors. If students feel their grade has been unfairly assigned, they are entitled to contest it following UCSB procedure for contesting grades.\nConduct. All course participants are expected to maintain respectful and honorable conduct consistent with UCSB ethical standards. Students uncomfortable with the behavior of another course participant for any reason should notify the instructor, course staff, or, if the complaint relates to course staff conduct, an administrative or departmental officer. Evidence of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct (OSC); evidence of problematic behavior will be addressed on a case-by-case basis in accord with university policies."

Arguably, for all of these reasons and because of its widespread use, Git/GitHub is a must for data scientists.\nIn this class you’ll learn and practice some basics that will allow you to easily access course files, collaborate with each other, and efficiently submit your coursework.

The most basic sequence that accomplishes the above steps is:\n\ngit pull update the local repository (technically, fetch changes + merge changes from the remote repository);\ngit add stage file changes to be committed to the local repository;\ngit commit commit staged changes to the local repository;\ngit push send committed changes back to the remote repository.\n\nSometimes contributors take different or additional actions; the complexity of the Git actions required to make a change depends largely on repository settings, permissions, and agreements among collaborators about how workflow should be structured."

    "text": "Basic Git actions\nHere you’ll make a local change and then push that change to the remote repository.\n\nPull\nThe first step to making a change is ensuring you have the most up-to-date version of the repository files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction (individual)\n\n\n\nPull changes from the remote repository.\n\nIn your GitHub client, open the group sandbox repository and then look for a ‘Pull’ menu item.\nIf you are using GitHub desktop, you can alternatively ‘fetch origin’ first via a toolbar button. This will retrieve changes but without modifying local files, and if changes are detected, a button will appear in the main screen of the client to pull changes.\nIn the terminal: navigate to the root directory of the repository and git pull\n\n\n\nNow check the repository history to see what changes you just pulled. In GitHub Desktop, there is a history tab on the left-hand side that lists commits chronologically. Select a commit to view line-by-line differences for every file that was altered.\nYou should see two changes: that there is now a class-activity folder containing a copy of this activity; and the README file has been updated. Look at the differences on the readme file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemark\n\n\n\nFetching vs. pulling\nFetching allows you to retrieve changes from the remote repository without merging them into your local repository. If there are commits that you haven’t merged, you can examine them before doing so in one of two ways:\n\nin the terminal, git diff main origin/main\nopen the remote repository on github.com and check the commit history (look for a clock icon with the number of commits in the upper right corner of the file navigator in the code menu); open any commit to see a line-by-line comparison of differences.\n\n\n\n\n\nMake changes\nNow that you have the most up-to-date version of all files, create a new markdown file in the class activity folder with a fun fact about you (or anything else if you’d rather) that you’ll upload to the repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction (individual)\n\n\n\nCreate a markdown file:\n\nIn RStudio, select File > New File > Markdown File\nAdd an ‘About Me’ or similar header (use one or more hashes # before the header text)\nWrite a fun fact about yourself\nSave the file as YOURGITHUBUSERNAME-about.md in the class activity folder\n\n\n\n\n\nStage and commit changes\nNow that your new file is ready to go you can stage the changes to be committed to the repository and create a commit.\nA commit is a bundle of changes that will be submitted to the repository along with a message briefly explaining the changes made. Your GitHub client will often fill in a default message such as ‘update FILENAME.EXT’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction (individual)\n\n\n\nStage and commit:\n\nIn your client, look for a menu item to add or stage changes. By default any changes made to any file will be included. In GitHub Desktop, look for the ‘Changes’ menu next to ‘History’; you can stage changes by simply selecting or unselecting the checkbox next to each file that was altered.\n\nOr in the terminal: git add FILENAME\n\nOnce you have staged changes, look for a menu item to commit changes. Add a message and commit the changes. In GitHub Desktop, this appears at the bottom of the ‘Changes’ menu.\n\nOr in the terminal: git add -m \"your message here\"\n\n\n\n\nOften these actions are performed together. However, in some workflows it may make sense to stage changes incrementally and create commits that bundle several changes at once. For example, if you need to make an update that requires modifying files A, B, and C, it may make sense to edit and stage changes to A first, followed by B, followed by C, and create the commit only once the full update has been implemented.\n\n\nPush\nThe last step is to push your commit to the remote repository. However, as you will see in a moment, too many people trying to push changes at once can create some problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction (group)\n\n\n\n\nChoose one person at your table to push their changes. The very first person to do this will have no problems, since their local repository is up to date with the remote.\nThen choose someone else to try – use the main screen at your workstation if possible so everyone at the table can see. Since the first person modified the remote repository, the next person to push changes will no longer be up to date. Git will detect this and the push won’t go through.\nHave the second person update their local repository by pulling changes, and then try the push again. It should go through once their local is up to date with the remote.\nHave everyone at your table pull changes but do not push any additional commits.\n\n\n\nSo far everyone is working on independent files and there’s no overlap between changes, so although it would be a bit of a hassle to have everyone check for changes every time they push, in principle it could be done. However, there is a more efficient way to work in parallel: by creating branches."

The code below might help you decide which variable to use and how to make the split: use it to inspect each of the two variables and decide which one better distinguishes the income groups.\n\n# comment out -- don't overwrite your bootstrap sample!\ncensus_boot <- census %>% \n  sample_n(size = 200, replace = T)\n\n# for continuous variables\ncensus_boot %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = age, # replace with predictor name \n             y = income)) +\n  geom_jitter(height = 0.1) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 35) # adjust cutoff\n\n\n\ncensus_boot %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = age, # replace with predictor name\n           y = ..density..)) +\n  geom_density(aes(color = income, fill = income),\n               alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 35) # adjust cutoff\n\n\n\n# for categorical variables\ncensus_boot %>%\n  group_by(workclass, income) %>%\n  count() %>%\n  spread(income, n) %>%\n  mutate_all(~ replace_na(.x, 0)) %>%\n  mutate(high.inc = `<=50K` > `>50K`)\n\n# A tibble: 7 × 4\n# Groups:   workclass [7]\n  workclass        `<=50K` `>50K` high.inc\n  <chr>              <int>  <int> <lgl>   \n1 ?                     11      1 TRUE    \n2 Federal-gov            4      2 TRUE    \n3 Local-gov             17      7 TRUE    \n4 Private              103     29 TRUE    \n5 Self-emp-inc           4      2 TRUE    \n6 Self-emp-not-inc       5      6 FALSE   \n7 State-gov              4      5 FALSE   \n\n# pick out categories that are majority high income\nhighinc_categories <- census_boot %>%\n  group_by(workclass, # replace with predictor name\n           income) %>%\n  count() %>%\n  spread(income, n) %>%\n  mutate_all(~ replace_na(.x, 0)) %>%\n  mutate(high.inc = `<=50K` < `>50K`) %>%\n  filter(high.inc == T) %>%\n  pull(workclass) # replace with predictor name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\nMake your first split\n\nChoose whichever of the two predictors you think best distinguishes the high income and low income groups.\nFind a cutoff value if the variable is continuous, or the categories that you will classify as high income if the variable is categorical.\nIf categorical, store a vector of the category names that are classified as high income (see code above). If continuous, store the cutoff value.\nWrite down the rule.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3b: find your second split\nNow filter the data to just those rows classified as (but not necessarily actually) high income based on your first split.\n\n# continuous case -- example\ncensus_boot_sub <- census_boot %>%\n  filter(age > cutoff)\n\n# categorical case -- example\ncensus_boot_sub <- census_boot %>%\n  filter(workclass %in% highinc_categories)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\nFind a second split\n\nRepeat step 3a but with the filtered data census_boot_sub instead of the full bootstrap sample.\nWrite down the rule.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: draw the tree\nWe could in theory keep creating binary splits until all observations are correctly classified. However, since we’re doing this by hand and just for illustration purposes, we’ll stop after two splits – it’ll be more of a sapling than a fully grown tree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\nMake a diagram\nDraw your tree on your group’s whiteboard. It should have just one ‘root’ node and just three ‘leaf’ nodes."

That’s a specific method of constructing a tree.\nHow did you decide which of your two variables to use? Could you write code to make the same choice automatically? This, it turns out, is the main challenge in fully automating the process. The recursive partitioning algorithm requires two things:\n\na criterion by which one split is considered ‘better’ than another\na stopping rule\n\nIt is fairly simple to compute the best cutoff (or categorical mapping) for a given predictor – one can do a brute-force search for the split that minimizes misclassifications. However, when there are many possible variables to split on, a criterion is needed to determine the best choice. You can read about how this is done in MDSR 11.1.1."

If you’ve already used RStudio, great – this will still serve to introduce you to how we’ll use RStudio projects in this class.\n\nRStudio Setup\n\nYour TA will briefly review the (default) layout of the RStudio IDE. You should be able to identify/find the following:\n\nconsole\nterminal\nfile navigator\nenvironment\nhistory\n\nWe’ll use several R packages throughout the quarter. Some of these we will install on the go, but we can install several that we’ll rely on now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\nInstall packages\nNavigate to the console and copy-paste the following commands. You only need to do this once. This will take a minute or two to complete.\n\n\n\n# package install list \nurl <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pstat197/pstat197a/main/materials/scripts/package-installs.R'\nsource(url)\n\n# clear environment\nrm(list = ls())\n\n\n\nCreate a local project\nProjects are a means of keeping your work organized. When you create a project in a directory on your local machine, RStudio keeps track of project metadata, history, and the working environment so that every time you open the project you see whatever you had open when you last closed it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\nCreate a new project:\n\nSelect File > New project\nCreate the project in a new directory as a subdirectory of your class folder\nName it example-project\n\nComment: when naming files it’s good practice to avoid spaces, special characters, and the like. A naming convention we try to follow: choose a descriptive name comprising 1-3 words or common abbreviations separated by hyphens.\n\n\nTake a moment to observe the file navigator. It should consist of a single example-project.Rproj file.\n\n\nAdd content\nWe may as well populate the project with a few files – so let’s add a dataset and write a short script, as if we’re just starting a data analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\nRetrieve data and store a local copy\n\nOpen a new script: File > New File > R Script\nIn the navigator, create a folder called data and a folder called scripts\nCopy and paste the code chunk below into your script.\nExecute once, then save in the scripts folder as data-retrieval.R and close\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# retrieve pollution data\nurl <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pstat197/pstat197a/main/materials/labs/lab1-setup/data/pollution.csv'\npollution <- read_csv(url)\n\n# write as csv to file\nwrite_csv(pollution, file = 'data/pollution.csv')\n\n# clear environment\nrm(list = ls())\n\n\nNext, we’ll do a simple regression analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\nCreate a script\n\nCreate a new script as before\nCopy-paste the code chunk below into your script\nExecute once and examine the results\nSave in the scripts folder as slr-analysis.R\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# load data\npollution <- read_csv('data/pollution.csv')\n\n# examine scatterplot with SLR fit\nggplot(pollution,\n       aes(x = log(SO2), y = Mort)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')\n\n\n\n# compute SLR fit\nfit <- lm(Mort ~ log(SO2), data = pollution)\nbroom::tidy(fit)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n  <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>\n1 (Intercept)    887.      17.6      50.4  1.37e-49\n2 log(SO2)        16.7      4.99      3.35 1.40e- 3\n\n# interpret\nfit_ci <- confint(fit, parm = 'log(SO2)')*log(1.2)\n\npaste('With 95% confidence, every 20% increase in sulfur dioxide pollution is associated with an increase in two-year mortality rate between', \n      round(fit_ci[1], 2), \n      'and', \n      round(fit_ci[2], 2), \n      'per 100k', sep = ' ') %>% \n  print()\n\n[1] \"With 95% confidence, every 20% increase in sulfur dioxide pollution is associated with an increase in two-year mortality rate between 1.23 and 4.87 per 100k\"\n\n\n\nCongrats on your first project!

    "text": "GitHub repositories\n\nWe will be distributing course assignments as repositories via GitHub Classroom. A repository is simply a storage space.\nHere we’ll walk you through how to access and copy the files in a repository just as you will for course assignments. The first step is to accept an assignment through a link we’ve given to you – this will create a repository for you with the files we intend for you to have.\nFor now, we’ll make a ‘group sandbox’ that you can play in during our next class meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\nAccept an assignment in GitHub Classroom\n\nFollow the link to accept the group-sandbox assignment. Since it’s a group assignment, you will be prompted to join a team.\nJoin the team for the table you sat at during last class meeting. If you don’t remember, check your attendance form receipt.\n\nYou should be directed to a team repository on github.com. You may need to refresh your browser. Keep this window open; you will need the URL.\n\n\n\nGit and GitHub\nAt some point in time – possibly quite recently – you had to install Git on your local machine, as well as create a GitHub account. So, Git and GitHub are two different things.\nGit is version control software that enables you to systematically track and control file changes within a repository – a collection of files possibly with some directory structure. (The definition of ‘repository’ is simply ‘storage place’.)\nGitHub is an online platform for hosting repositories remotely. Anyone with access to a repository can make changes to files in the repository, and this enables multiple people to collaborate on code.\n\n\nlocal <> remote\nUsually remote repositories are not updated directly because contributors need to execute codes to test their changes and the remote server that hosts the repository is not equipped to do this.\nInstead, contributors will prepare changes on their own machine where they can test them, and then update the remote repository once their changes are complete.\nThis process of implementing file changes in a repository involves communicating information between local and remote locations. For this purpose a local copy of the remote repository is needed.\n\n\nCloning a repository\nIn Git lingo, a clone is a local copy of a remote repository. Creating a clone copies files and establishes the link between local and remote repositories so that changes can be sent to and received from the remote repository. You only need to create a clone once.\nTo clone a repository, all one needs is:\n\nthe remote location URL;\nthe local destination where the clone will be created;\npermission from the repository owner, if private.\n\nHere you’ll clone the group sandbox repository you just created/joined. You will need the URL; if you happened to close the page when you accepted the assignment earlier, you should be able to find the repository from your home page on github.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\nClone the sandbox repository:\n\nOpen your GitHub client (GitKracken or GitHub Desktop or similar) and ensure you are logged in to your GitHub account.\nLook for a ‘Clone Repo’ menu item or similar and simply input the URL and the place you’d like to clone it; proceed through any prompts.\nCheck your file navigator to confirm that the repository files were copied.\n\n\n\n\nAn alternative possibility is to create the clone using a terminal command. In the terminal, navigate to the desired destination, and input:\ngit clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPONAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemarks\n\n\n\nOn terminal commands:\n\nIt’s recommended to manage Git actions through a visual client, as it’s much easier to see and understand what’s happening.\nHowever, if you know exactly what you’re doing, executing simple actions via Git bash in the terminal can be more efficient at times.\nFor example, you can keep a terminal open in RStudio and manage your repository workflow from there, without having to toggle between environments.\nTry experimenting with terminal commands from RStudio after you have a little experience with basic Git actions."

    "section": "Data types",
    "text": "Data types\nThere are five main data types in R.\nNumeric (double- or single-precision floating point) data represent real numbers. Numeric data are abbreviated num and by default are stored as double-precision floating point.\n\n# a number\n4.5\n\n[1] 4.5\n\n# check structure\nstr(4.5)\n\n num 4.5\n\n# stored as double\nis.double(4.5)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nInteger data are integers. For the most part they behave like numeric data, except occupy less memory, which can in some cases be convenient. To distinguish integers from doubles, R uses a trailing L after values; the data type is abbreviated int.\n\n# an integer\n4L\n\n[1] 4\n\n# check structure\nstr(4L)\n\n int 4\n\n\nLogical data are binary and represented in R as having values TRUE and FALSE. They are abbreviated logi in R. Often they are automatically coerced to integer data with values 0 (false) and 1 (true) to perform arithmetic and other operations.\n\n# logical value\nTRUE\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n# check structure\nstr(TRUE)\n\n logi TRUE\n\n# arithmetic\nTRUE + FALSE\n\n[1] 1\n\n# check structure\nstr(FALSE + FALSE)\n\n int 0\n\n\nCharacter data represent strings of text and are sometimes called ‘strings’. They are abbreviated chr in R and values are surrounded by quotation marks; this distinguishes, for example, the character 4 from the number 4. Single quotations can be used to input strings as well as double quotations. Arithmetic is not possible with strings for obvious reasons.\n\n# a character string\n'yay'\n\n[1] \"yay\"\n\n# check structure\nstr('yay')\n\n chr \"yay\"\n\n# string arithmetic won't work\n'4' + '1'\n\nError in \"4\" + \"1\": non-numeric argument to binary operator\n\n# but can be performed after coercing character to string\nas.numeric('4') + as.numeric('1')\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nFactor data represent categorical variables. In R these are encoded numerically according to the number of ‘levels’ of the factor, which represent the unique values of the categorical variable, and each level is labeled. R will print the labels, not the levels, of factors; the data type is abbreviated fct.\n\n# a factor\nfactor(1, levels = c(1, 2), labels = c('blue', 'red'))\n\n[1] blue\nLevels: blue red\n\n# less verbose definition\nfactor('blue', levels = c('blue', 'red'))\n\n[1] blue\nLevels: blue red\n\n# check structure\nstr(factor('blue', levels = c('blue', 'red')))\n\n Factor w/ 2 levels \"blue\",\"red\": 1\n\n\nUsually factors won’t be defined explicitly, but instead interpreted from character data. The levels and labels of factors can be manipulated using a variety of helper functions."

    "text": "Object classes\nThe most basic type of object in R is a vector. Vectors are concatenations of data values of the same type. They are defined using the concatenation operator c() and are indexed by consecutive integers; subvectors can be retrieved by specifying the indices between square brackets.\n\n# numeric vector\nc(1, 4, 7)\n\n[1] 1 4 7\n\n# character vector\nc('blue', 'red')\n\n[1] \"blue\" \"red\" \n\n# indexing\nc(1, 4, 7)[1]\n\n[1] 1\n\nc(1, 4, 7)[2]\n\n[1] 4\n\nc(1, 4, 7)[3]\n\n[1] 7\n\nc(1, 4, 7)[2:3]\n\n[1] 4 7\n\nc(1, 4, 7)[c(1, 3)]\n\n[1] 1 7\n\n\nUsually objects are assigned names for easy retrieval. Vectors will not show any special object class if the structure is examined; str() will simply return the data type, index range, and the values.\n\n# assign a name\nmy_vec <- c(1, 4, 7)\n\n# check structure\nstr(my_vec)\n\n num [1:3] 1 4 7\n\n\nNext up in complexity are arrays. These are blocks of data values of the same type indexed along two or more dimensions. For arrays, str() will return the data type, index structure, and data values; when printed directly, data values are arranged according to the indexing.\n\n# an array\nmy_ary <- array(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), \n           dim = c(2, 4))\n\nmy_ary\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]\n[1,]    1    3    5    7\n[2,]    2    4    6    8\n\nstr(my_ary)\n\n num [1:2, 1:4] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\n# another array\nmy_oth_ary <- array(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), \n           dim = c(2, 2, 2))\n\nmy_oth_ary\n\n, , 1\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    3\n[2,]    2    4\n\n, , 2\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    5    7\n[2,]    6    8\n\nstr(my_oth_ary)\n\n num [1:2, 1:2, 1:2] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\n\nFor arrays, elements can be retrieved by index coordinates, and slices can be retrieved by leaving index positions blank, which will return all elements along the corresponding indices.\n\n# one element\nmy_ary[1, 2]\n\n[1] 3\n\n# one element\nmy_oth_ary[1, 2, 1]\n\n[1] 3\n\n# a slice (second row)\nmy_ary[2, ]\n\n[1] 2 4 6 8\n\n# a slice (first layer)\nmy_oth_ary[ , , 1]\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    3\n[2,]    2    4\n\n\nNext there are lists, which are perhaps the most flexible data structure. A list is an indexed collection of any objects.\n\n# a list\nlist('cat', c(1, 4, 7), TRUE)\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"cat\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 1 4 7\n\n[[3]]\n[1] TRUE\n\n# a named list\nlist(animal = 'cat',\n     numbers = c(1, 4, 7),\n     short = TRUE)\n\n$animal\n[1] \"cat\"\n\n$numbers\n[1] 1 4 7\n\n$short\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nList elements can be retrieved by index in double square brackets, or by name.\n\n# assign a name\nmy_lst <- list(animal = 'cat',\n               numbers = c(1, 4, 7),\n               short = TRUE)\n\n# check structure\nstr(my_lst)\n\nList of 3\n $ animal : chr \"cat\"\n $ numbers: num [1:3] 1 4 7\n $ short  : logi TRUE\n\n# retrieve an element\nmy_lst[[1]]\n\n[1] \"cat\"\n\n# equivalent\nmy_lst$animal\n\n[1] \"cat\"\n\n\nFinally, data frames are type-heterogeneous lists of vectors of equal length. More informally, they are 2D arrays with columns of differing data types. str() will essentially show the list structure; but when printed, data frames will appear arranged in a table.\n\n# a data frame\nmy_df <- data.frame(animal = c('cat', 'hare', 'tortoise'),\n                    has.fur = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE),\n                    weight.lbs = c(9.1, 8.2, 22.7))\n\nstr(my_df)\n\n'data.frame':   3 obs. of  3 variables:\n $ animal    : chr  \"cat\" \"hare\" \"tortoise\"\n $ has.fur   : logi  TRUE TRUE FALSE\n $ weight.lbs: num  9.1 8.2 22.7\n\nmy_df\n\n    animal has.fur weight.lbs\n1      cat    TRUE        9.1\n2     hare    TRUE        8.2\n3 tortoise   FALSE       22.7\n\n\nThe data frame is the standard object type for representing datasets in R. For the most part, modern computing in R is designed around the data frame."

suggest any patterns?\n\n\n\n\n\nSummaries\nSummaries are easily computed across rows using summarize() . So if for example we want to use the filtering and selection from before to find the proportion of advanced students in statistics with research experience, use:\n\n# a summary\nbackground %>%\n  filter(stat.prof == 'Adv') %>%\n  mutate(avg.comf = (math.comf + prog.comf + stat.comf)/3) %>%\n  select(avg.comf, rsrch) %>%\n  summarize(prop.rsrch = mean(rsrch))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  prop.rsrch\n       <dbl>\n1      0.611\n\n# equivalent\nbackground %>%\n  filter(stat.prof == 'Adv') %>%\n  mutate(avg.comf = (math.comf + prog.comf + stat.comf)/3) %>%\n  select(avg.comf, rsrch) %>%\n  pull(rsrch) %>%\n  mean()\n\n[1] 0.6111111\n\n\nThe advantage of summarize , however, is that multiple summaries can be computed at once:\n\nbackground %>%\n  filter(stat.prof == 'Adv') %>%\n  mutate(avg.comf = (math.comf + prog.comf + stat.comf)/3) %>%\n  select(avg.comf, rsrch) %>%\n  summarize(prop.rsrch = mean(rsrch),\n            med.comf = median(avg.comf))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  prop.rsrch med.comf\n       <dbl>    <dbl>\n1      0.611        4\n\n\nThe variant summarize_all computes the same summary across all columns. (Notice the use of the helper verb contains() to select all columns containing a particular string.)\n\n# average comfort levels across all students\nbackground %>%\n  select(contains('comf')) %>%\n  summarise_all(.funs = mean)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  prog.comf math.comf stat.comf\n      <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>\n1      3.97      3.85      4.08\n\n\nGrouped summaries are summaries computed separately among subsets of observations. To define a grouping structure using an existing column, use group_by() . Notice the ‘groups’ attribute printed with the output.\n\n# create a grouping\nbackground %>%\n  group_by(stat.prof)\n\n# A tibble: 59 × 30\n# Groups:   stat.prof [3]\n   response.id prog.prof prog.comf math.prof math.comf stat.prof stat.comf\n         <dbl> <chr>         <dbl> <chr>         <dbl> <chr>         <dbl>\n 1           1 Adv               5 Int               3 Adv               4\n 2           2 Int               5 Int               3 Int               4\n 3           3 Int               3 Int               3 Int               4\n 4           4 Int               3 Int               3 Int               3\n 5           5 Int               3 Adv               4 Int               3\n 6           7 Int               3 Adv               4 Int               3\n 7           8 Adv               4 Adv               5 Adv               4\n 8           9 Int               3 Int               3 Int               3\n 9          10 Int               4 Int               3 Adv               4\n10          12 Int               5 Int               4 Int               4\n# … with 49 more rows, and 23 more variables: updv.num <chr>, dom <chr>,\n#   consent <chr>, PSTAT100 <chr>, `PSTAT120A-B` <chr>, PSTAT126 <chr>,\n#   PSTAT127 <chr>, PSTAT134 <chr>, CS9 <chr>, PSTAT131 <chr>, PSTAT174 <chr>,\n#   LING104 <chr>, LING105 <chr>, PSTAT115 <chr>, PSTAT122 <chr>,\n#   `PSTAT160A-B` <chr>, CS16 <chr>, `CS5A-B` <chr>, POLS15 <chr>,\n#   LING110 <chr>, `CS130A-B` <chr>, `CS165A-B` <chr>, rsrch <lgl>\n\n\nSometimes it can be helpful to simply count the observations in each group:\n\n# count observations\nbackground %>%\n  group_by(stat.prof) %>%\n  count()\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n# Groups:   stat.prof [3]\n  stat.prof     n\n  <chr>     <int>\n1 Adv          36\n2 Beg           2\n3 Int          21\n\n\nTo compute a grouped summary, first group the data frame and then specify the summary of interest:\n\n# a grouped summary\nbackground %>%\n  group_by(stat.prof) %>%\n  select(contains('.comf')) %>%\n  summarize_all(.funs = mean)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 4\n  stat.prof prog.comf math.comf stat.comf\n  <chr>         <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>\n1 Adv            4.06      4.14      4.39\n2 Beg            3.5       2.5       2.5 \n3 Int            3.86      3.48      3.71\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\nGrouped summaries\n\nCompute the median comfort level of all students in each subject area.\nCompute the median comfort level of all students in each subject area after grouping by number of upper division classes taken.\nCompare and discuss with your neighbor: do you notice any interesting patterns?"

By default, the output is one row with one column for each summary/variable combination:\n\n# many variables, many summaries\ncomf_sum <- background %>%\n  select(contains('comf')) %>%\n  summarise_all(.funs = list(mean = mean, \n                             median = median,\n                             min = min, \n                             max = max))\n\ncomf_sum\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 12\n  prog.comf_mean math.comf_mean stat.comf_mean prog.comf_median math.comf_median\n           <dbl>          <dbl>          <dbl>            <dbl>            <dbl>\n1           3.97           3.85           4.08                4                4\n# … with 7 more variables: stat.comf_median <dbl>, prog.comf_min <dbl>,\n#   math.comf_min <dbl>, stat.comf_min <dbl>, prog.comf_max <dbl>,\n#   math.comf_max <dbl>, stat.comf_max <dbl>\n\n\nIt would be much better to reshape this into a table. gather will reshape the data frame from wide format to long format by ‘gathering’ the columns together.\n\n# gather columns into long format\ncomf_sum %>% gather(stat, val) \n\n# A tibble: 12 × 2\n   stat               val\n   <chr>            <dbl>\n 1 prog.comf_mean    3.97\n 2 math.comf_mean    3.85\n 3 stat.comf_mean    4.08\n 4 prog.comf_median  4   \n 5 math.comf_median  4   \n 6 stat.comf_median  4   \n 7 prog.comf_min     3   \n 8 math.comf_min     2   \n 9 stat.comf_min     2   \n10 prog.comf_max     5   \n11 math.comf_max     5   \n12 stat.comf_max     5   \n\n\nThis is a little better, but it would be more legible in a 2x2 table. We can separate the ‘stat’ variable that has the column names into two columns:\n\n# separate into rows and columns\ncomf_sum %>%\n  gather(stat, val) %>%\n  separate(stat, into = c('variable', 'stat'), sep = '_') \n\n# A tibble: 12 × 3\n   variable  stat     val\n   <chr>     <chr>  <dbl>\n 1 prog.comf mean    3.97\n 2 math.comf mean    3.85\n 3 stat.comf mean    4.08\n 4 prog.comf median  4   \n 5 math.comf median  4   \n 6 stat.comf median  4   \n 7 prog.comf min     3   \n 8 math.comf min     2   \n 9 stat.comf min     2   \n10 prog.comf max     5   \n11 math.comf max     5   \n12 stat.comf max     5   \n\n\nAnd then spread the stat column over a few rows, resulting in a table where the rows are the variables and the columns are the summaries:\n\n# spread into table\ncomf_sum %>%\n  gather(stat, val) %>%\n  separate(stat, into = c('variable', 'stat'), sep = '_') %>%\n  spread(stat, val)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 5\n  variable    max  mean median   min\n  <chr>     <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl>\n1 math.comf     5  3.85      4     2\n2 prog.comf     5  3.97      4     3\n3 stat.comf     5  4.08      4     2"

In the chunk above, the first argument to ggplot() is the data. Then, aes() defines an ‘aesthetic mapping’ of the columns of the input data frame to graphical elements. This defines a set of axes. Then, a layer of points is added to the plot with geom_point() ; no arguments are needed because the geometric object (‘geom’) inherits attributes (x and y coordinates) from the aesthetic mapping.\nAgain we might prefer to arrange the classes by descending order in proportion.\n\nfig <- classes %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = proportion, y = reorder(class, proportion))) +\n  geom_point()\n\nfig\n\n\n\n\nAnd perhaps fix the plot labels:\n\n# adjust labels\nfig + labs(x = 'proportion of class', y = '')\n\n\n\n\nNotice that ggplot allows for a plot to be stored by name and then further modified with additional layers."

For example:\n\nfor(i in 1:4){\n  print(2*i)\n}\n\n[1] 2\n[1] 4\n[1] 6\n[1] 8\n\n\nHere the instructions are:\n\ninitialize index/flag i at i = 1\nexecute code within the braces {...}\nincrement i <- i + 1\nrepeat steps 2-3 until i = 5\n\nWe could make the loop a bit more verbose:\n\nflag_vals <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)\nfor(i in flag_vals){\n  out <- 2*i\n  print(out)\n}\n\n[1] 2\n[1] 4\n[1] 6\n[1] 8\n\n\nNow to retain the results in memory, a storage data structure must be defined and the output of each iteration assigned to some element(s) of the storage object.\n\nrslt <- rep(NA, 4)\nfor(i in 1:4){\n  rslt[i] <- 2*i\n}\nrslt\n\n[1] 2 4 6 8\n\n\nIf we want to perform the same calculation for all values in a vector, we might do something like this:\n\nrslt <- rep(NA, 4)\ninput_vals <- c(15, 27, 3, 12.6)\nfor(i in 1:4){\n  rslt[i] <- 2*input_vals[i]\n}\nrslt\n\n[1] 30.0 54.0  6.0 25.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck your understanding\n\n\n\nWhy does the following loop produce an NA ?\n\nrslt <- rep(NA, 4)\ninput_vals <- rnorm(n = 3)\nfor(i in 1:4){\n  rslt[i] <- 2*input_vals[i]\n}\n\nrslt\n\n[1] -3.3664950 -0.5316422  1.2368258         NA\n\n\n\n\nLoops are substantially similar in any programming language but usually not optimized for performance. Additionally, they are somewhat verbose and hard to read due to explicit use of indexing in the syntax.\n\n\nMultiple testing with loops\nIn base R, the \\(t\\)-test is performed using t.test(...) , which takes as arguments two vectors of observations (one for each group). For instance:\n\nx <- asd %>% filter(group == 'ASD') %>% pull(CHIP)\ny <- asd %>% filter(group == 'TD') %>% pull(CHIP)\nt.test(x, y, var.equal = F)\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  x and y\nt = -0.18812, df = 151.74, p-value = 0.851\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.2588194  0.2138173\nsample estimates:\n  mean of x   mean of y \n-0.04922954 -0.02672849 \n\n\nThe output is a list:\n\nt.test(x, y) %>% str()\n\nList of 10\n $ statistic  : Named num -0.188\n  ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr \"t\"\n $ parameter  : Named num 152\n  ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr \"df\"\n $ p.value    : num 0.851\n $ conf.int   : num [1:2] -0.259 0.214\n  ..- attr(*, \"conf.level\")= num 0.95\n $ estimate   : Named num [1:2] -0.0492 -0.0267\n  ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr [1:2] \"mean of x\" \"mean of y\"\n $ null.value : Named num 0\n  ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr \"difference in means\"\n $ stderr     : num 0.12\n $ alternative: chr \"two.sided\"\n $ method     : chr \"Welch Two Sample t-test\"\n $ data.name  : chr \"x and y\"\n - attr(*, \"class\")= chr \"htest\"\n\n\nSo if we want the p-value:\n\nt.test(x, y, var.equal = F)$p.value\n\n[1] 0.8510352\n\n\nTo calculate \\(p\\)-values for all tests using a loop, we wrap the code we used to perform one \\(t\\)-test in a for loop and add appropriate indexing. For speed, we’ll just compute the first 100 tests:\n\nn_tests <- 100\np_vals <- rep(NA, n_tests)\nfor(i in 1:n_tests){\n  x <- asd %>% filter(group == 'ASD') %>% pull(i + 1)\n  y <- asd %>% filter(group == 'TD') %>% pull(i + 1)\n  p_vals[i] <- t.test(x, y, var.equal = F)$p.value\n}\n\nTo line these up with the proteins they correspond to, it’s necessary to keep track of the indexing carefully. In this case, the indexing corresponds to the order of columns. So we could create a data frame like so:\n\ntibble(protein = colnames(asd)[2:(n_tests + 1)],\n       p = p_vals)\n\n# A tibble: 100 × 2\n   protein        p\n   <chr>      <dbl>\n 1 CHIP     0.851  \n 2 CEBPB    0.0322 \n 3 NSE      0.350  \n 4 PIAS4    0.104  \n 5 IL-10 Ra 0.0232 \n 6 STAT3    0.00183\n 7 IRF1     0.592  \n 8 c-Jun    0.0351 \n 9 Mcl-1    0.999  \n10 OAS1     0.942  \n# … with 90 more rows\n\n\nAlternatively, we could have set up the loop to output this result:\n\nn_tests <- 100\nrslt <- tibble(protein = colnames(asd)[2:(n_tests + 1)],\n               p = NA)\nfor(i in 1:n_tests){\n  x <- asd %>% filter(group == 'ASD') %>% pull(i + 1)\n  y <- asd %>% filter(group == 'TD') %>% pull(i + 1)\n  rslt$p[i] <- t.test(x, y, var.equal = F)$p.value\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\nFollow the example above to write a loop that stores both the \\(p\\)-values and the estimated differences for the first 50 proteins."

    "text": "Tidyverse\nA final strategy for iteration comes from functional programming tools in tidyverse . The basic idea is:\n\ndefine a grouping structure using relevant variables (in this case, proteins)\ncollapse the data into separate data frames by group\napply a function to each data frame that produces test output given input data\n\n\nNesting\nOne thing that tibbles can do that data frames cannot is store list-columns: columns that are lists of arbitrary objects. This allows for the arrangement of a much more general collection of objects in tabular form.\nAn intuitive example is nested data: a list-column of data frames having the same columns. If we nest the ASD data by protein, we obtain a data frame that looks like this:\n\nasd_nested <- asd %>%\n  pivot_longer(-group, \n               names_to = 'protein', \n               values_to = 'level') %>%\n  nest(data = c(level, group))\n\nasd_nested %>% head(5)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  protein  data              \n  <chr>    <list>            \n1 CHIP     <tibble [154 × 2]>\n2 CEBPB    <tibble [154 × 2]>\n3 NSE      <tibble [154 × 2]>\n4 PIAS4    <tibble [154 × 2]>\n5 IL-10 Ra <tibble [154 × 2]>\n\n\nThe data column consists of data frames, one per protein, containing the variables group and level :\n\nasd_nested %>%\n  slice(1L) %>%\n  pull(data)\n\n[[1]]\n# A tibble: 154 × 2\n     level group\n     <dbl> <chr>\n 1  0.335  ASD  \n 2 -0.0715 ASD  \n 3 -0.406  ASD  \n 4 -0.102  ASD  \n 5 -0.395  ASD  \n 6 -0.126  ASD  \n 7  0.486  ASD  \n 8 -0.990  ASD  \n 9 -0.108  ASD  \n10  0.485  ASD  \n# … with 144 more rows\n\n\n\n\nThe map() function\nIn an ordinary data frame one can define a new variable as a function of other variables. The same can be done with list-columns in a tibble: one can define a new variable as a function of the elements of a list stored in another column. To do this, one uses the map() function, which is essentially the tidyverse version of lapply() :\n\nmap(.x, .fn) means roughly “apply the function .fn to each element in .x”\n\nHere we can write a function that takes a data frame with protein level and group as input, and returns a t test as output; then computing each test is as simple as calling mutate :\n\ntt_fn <- function(.df){\n  t.test(level ~ group, data = .df)\n}\n\nrslt <- asd_nested %>%\n  slice(1:10) %>%\n  mutate(ttest.out = map(data, tt_fn))\n\nrslt\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 3\n   protein  data               ttest.out\n   <chr>    <list>             <list>   \n 1 CHIP     <tibble [154 × 2]> <htest>  \n 2 CEBPB    <tibble [154 × 2]> <htest>  \n 3 NSE      <tibble [154 × 2]> <htest>  \n 4 PIAS4    <tibble [154 × 2]> <htest>  \n 5 IL-10 Ra <tibble [154 × 2]> <htest>  \n 6 STAT3    <tibble [154 × 2]> <htest>  \n 7 IRF1     <tibble [154 × 2]> <htest>  \n 8 c-Jun    <tibble [154 × 2]> <htest>  \n 9 Mcl-1    <tibble [154 × 2]> <htest>  \n10 OAS1     <tibble [154 × 2]> <htest>  \n\nrslt %>% slice(1L) %>% pull(ttest.out)\n\n[[1]]\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  level by group\nt = -0.18812, df = 151.74, p-value = 0.851\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group ASD and group TD is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.2588194  0.2138173\nsample estimates:\nmean in group ASD  mean in group TD \n      -0.04922954       -0.02672849 \n\n\nWhile all the data we might want are there, the output is a little unwieldy. Luckily, the infer package contains a pipe-operator-friendly function infer::t_test that returns results in a tidy fashion.\n\nasd_nested %>% \n  slice(1L) %>% \n  unnest(cols = data) %>% \n  infer::t_test(formula = level ~ group,\n         order = c('ASD', 'TD'),\n         alternative = 'two-sided',\n         var.equal = F)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 7\n  statistic  t_df p_value alternative estimate lower_ci upper_ci\n      <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl> <chr>          <dbl>    <dbl>    <dbl>\n1    -0.188  152.   0.851 two.sided    -0.0225   -0.259    0.214\n\n\nWe can create a wrapper around this function suitable for our purposes and then apply it to the list-column in asd_nested :\n\n# wrapper around infer::t_test\ntt_fn <- function(.df){\n  infer::t_test(.df, \n         formula = level ~ group,\n         order = c('ASD', 'TD'),\n         alternative = 'two-sided',\n         var.equal = F)\n}\n\n# compute test results\ntt_out <- asd_nested %>%\n  slice(1:n_tests) %>%\n  mutate(ttest = map(data, tt_fn))\n\n# preview\ntt_out %>% head(4)\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 3\n  protein data               ttest           \n  <chr>   <list>             <list>          \n1 CHIP    <tibble [154 × 2]> <tibble [1 × 7]>\n2 CEBPB   <tibble [154 × 2]> <tibble [1 × 7]>\n3 NSE     <tibble [154 × 2]> <tibble [1 × 7]>\n4 PIAS4   <tibble [154 × 2]> <tibble [1 × 7]>\n\n\nNotice that ttest is also a list-column comprised of separate data frames. This column can be un-nested to show the output of infer::t_test explicitly:\n\ntt_out %>% \n  unnest(ttest) %>%\n  head(4)\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 9\n  protein data     statistic  t_df p_value alternative estimate lower_ci\n  <chr>   <list>       <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl> <chr>          <dbl>    <dbl>\n1 CHIP    <tibble>    -0.188  152.  0.851  two.sided    -0.0225  -0.259 \n2 CEBPB   <tibble>     2.16   150.  0.0322 two.sided     0.317    0.0273\n3 NSE     <tibble>     0.937  151.  0.350  two.sided     0.148   -0.164 \n4 PIAS4   <tibble>     1.64   152.  0.104  two.sided     0.222   -0.0459\n# … with 1 more variable: upper_ci <dbl>\n\n\nThis approach has a few advantages, namely, it is syntactically more readable than either of the other approaches and it works with the pipe operator, so could in theory be incorporated into a chain that performs additional calculations on, say, the results of the \\(t\\)-test. However, the drawback is that it is slow:\n\n# time it\nstart <- Sys.time()\ntt_out <- asd_nested %>%\n  slice(1:n_tests) %>%\n  mutate(ttest = map(data, tt_fn))\nend <- Sys.time()\n\nend - start\n\nTime difference of 4.896297 secs\n\n\nIt’s not as slow as a for loop, but it’s much slower than apply functions. If speed is a concern or the number of iterations is especially large, apply would be a better choice.\n\n\nAdjusting p-values\nTo adjust the \\(p\\)-values, we simply manipulate the p_value column:\n\n# bonferroni correction\ntt_out %>% \n  unnest(ttest) %>%\n  mutate(p_adj = p_value*n_tests) %>%\n  select(protein, p_value, p_adj) %>%\n  arrange(p_adj) %>%\n  head(4)\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 3\n  protein     p_value     p_adj\n  <chr>         <dbl>     <dbl>\n1 FSTL1   0.000000466 0.0000466\n2 C1QR1   0.000000479 0.0000479\n3 DSC2    0.000129    0.0129   \n4 HIF-1a  0.000196    0.0196   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\nImplement the Benjamini-Hochberg correction\n\nSort the raw \\(p\\)-values using arrange()\nAdd a rank column of consecutive integers (neat trick: try using row_number())\nAdd a column p_adj containing \\(\\frac{m}{i} p_{(i)}\\) where \\(m\\) is the number of tests, \\(i\\) is the rank of the \\(p\\)-value, and \\(p_{(i)}\\) is the \\(i\\)th smallest \\(p\\)-value\nFind the collection of proteins with significantly different serum levels between the ASD and TD groups while controlling the false discovery rate at 1%.\n\nDevelop working code to execute 50 tests.

One need only:\n\nprovide the predicted and true labels as factors\nindicate which factor is the truth and which is the prediction\nindicate which factor level is considered a ‘positive’\n\n\n# store predictions as factors\npred_df <- testing(partitions) %>%\n  add_predictions(fit, type = 'response') %>%\n  mutate(pred.class = (pred > 0.5),\n         group = factor(class, labels = c('TD', 'ASD')),\n         pred.group = factor(pred.class, labels = c('TD', 'ASD'))) \n\n# check order of factor levels\npred_df %>% pull(group) %>% levels()\n\n[1] \"TD\"  \"ASD\"\n\n# compute specificity\npred_df %>%\n  specificity(truth = group, \n              estimate = pred.group,\n              event_level = 'second')\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  .metric     .estimator .estimate\n  <chr>       <chr>          <dbl>\n1 specificity binary         0.625\n\n\nThe second level is ASD, which in this context is a positive. We knew since we supplied the labels in defining the factors, and the order of levels will match the order of labels. However, we can also check as above using levels() . Hence, event_level = 'second' .\nSensitivity, accuracy, and other metrics can be computed similarly:\n\n# sensitivity\npred_df %>%\n  sensitivity(truth = group,\n              estimate = pred.group,\n              event_level = 'second')\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  .metric     .estimator .estimate\n  <chr>       <chr>          <dbl>\n1 sensitivity binary           0.8\n\n\nYou can check the package documentation for a complete list of available metrics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\nCompute the accuracy\nFind the appropriate function from the package documentation (link immediately above) and use it to compute the accuracy.\nRemark: from the table, you know the result should be \\(\\frac{10 + 12}{10 + 12 + 6 + 3} \\approx 0.7097\\) .\n\n\nThe package also has a helper function that allows you to define a panel of metrics so that you can compute several simultaneously. If we want a panel of specificity and sensitivity, the following will do the trick:\n\n# define panel (arguments must be yardstick metric function names)\npanel_fn <- metric_set(sensitivity, specificity)\n\n# compute\npred_df %>%\n  panel_fn(truth = group,\n           estimate = pred.group,\n           event_level = 'second')\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  .metric     .estimator .estimate\n  <chr>       <chr>          <dbl>\n1 sensitivity binary         0.8  \n2 specificity binary         0.625\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\nCompute a panel of precision, recall, and F1 score\n\nFind the appropriate yardstick functions and define a metric panel\nCompute on the test data\n\n\n\nAs a final comment, the table of classifications can be obtained in yardstick using the conf_mat() function. (The cross-classification table of predicted versus actual classes is called a confusion matrix.)\n\npred_df %>% conf_mat(truth = group, estimate = pred.group)\n\n          Truth\nPrediction TD ASD\n       TD  10   3\n       ASD  6  12"

ROC curves and AUROC are examples.\nroc_curve() will find all unique probability thresholds and, for each threshold, calculate sensitivity and specificity:\n\npred_df %>%\n  roc_curve(truth = group, estimate = pred)\n\n# A tibble: 33 × 3\n   .threshold specificity sensitivity\n        <dbl>       <dbl>       <dbl>\n 1  -Inf           0            1    \n 2     0.0664      0            1    \n 3     0.117       0            0.938\n 4     0.158       0            0.875\n 5     0.186       0.0667       0.875\n 6     0.191       0.0667       0.812\n 7     0.197       0.0667       0.75 \n 8     0.262       0.0667       0.688\n 9     0.284       0.0667       0.625\n10     0.299       0.133        0.625\n# … with 23 more rows\n\n\nThis can be used to plot the ROC curve:\n\npred_df %>%\n  roc_curve(truth = group, \n            estimate = pred,\n            event_level = 'second') %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = sensitivity, x = 1 - specificity)) +\n  geom_path() +\n  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0)\n\n\n\n\nIn this case the ROC curve is so choppy because the test set only includes 31 observations. In general, for a collection of \\(n\\) observations there are at most \\(n + 1\\) unique thresholds and usually considerably fewer.\nThe area under the ROC curve is also easy to compute:\n\npred_df %>% roc_auc(truth = group, \n                    estimate = pred,\n                    event_level = 'second')\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  .metric .estimator .estimate\n  <chr>   <chr>          <dbl>\n1 roc_auc binary         0.712\n\n\n\n\nCombined metric types\nIf you wish to compute both classification metrics based on a class prediction and class probability metrics based on a probability prediction in a metric panel, the classification should be provided as the argument to estimate = ... and class probability column can be provided as an unnamed argument following the estimate argument.\nFor example:\n\npanel <- metric_set(roc_auc, accuracy) \n\npred_df %>% panel(truth = group,\n                  estimate = pred.group,\n                  pred,\n                  event_level = 'second')\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  .metric  .estimator .estimate\n  <chr>    <chr>          <dbl>\n1 accuracy binary         0.710\n2 roc_auc  binary         0.712\n\n\n\n\nExploring partitions\nReview this section if you want a deeper understanding of data partitioning.\nThe rationale for partitioning is that held out data will give a more honest assessment. Conversely, evaluating accuracy on data used to fit a model will provide an overly optimistic assessment.\nWe can experimentally confirm this intuition by:\n\nrepeatedly partitioning the data at random\nevaluating accuracy on both partitions\naveraging across partitions\n\nThis procedure will reveal that on average the accuracy is better on training data. Don’t worry too much about the computations; focus on the output and the concepts.\nWe’ll use the tidyverse iteration strategy from lab 3. First we’ll need some helper functions that are basically wrappers around each step we went through in this lab:\n\nfitting a model\nadding predictions\nevaluating metrics\n\n\n# define some helper functions\nfit_fn <- function(.df){\n  glm(class ~ ., family = 'binomial', data = .df)\n}\n\npred_fn <- function(.df, .mdl){\n  .df %>% add_predictions(.mdl, type = 'response')\n}\n\npanel <- metric_set(sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, roc_auc)\n\neval_fn <- function(.df){\n  .df %>%\n    mutate(group = factor(class, labels = c('TD', 'ASD')),\n           pred.group = factor(pred > 0.5, labels = c('TD', 'ASD'))) %>%\n    panel(truth = group,\n          estimate = pred.group,\n          pred,\n          event_level = 'second')\n  \n}\n\nNow let’s create 400 random partitions of the data and perform the steps in this lab for every partition. In addition, we’ll compute predictions and evaluate accuracy on the training set, which we did not do above and is generally not done.\n\nset.seed(101922)\nn_splits <- 400\nout <- tibble(partition = 1:n_splits,\n       split = map(partition, ~ initial_split(biomarker, prop = 0.8)),\n       train = map(split, training),\n       test = map(split, testing),\n       fit = map(train, fit_fn),\n       pred_test = map2(test, fit, pred_fn),\n       pred_train = map2(train, fit, pred_fn),\n       eval_test = map(pred_test, eval_fn),\n       eval_train = map(pred_train, eval_fn))\n\nout %>% head(4)\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 9\n  partition split            train    test     fit    pred_test pred_train\n      <int> <list>           <list>   <list>   <list> <list>    <list>    \n1         1 <split [123/31]> <tibble> <tibble> <glm>  <tibble>  <tibble>  \n2         2 <split [123/31]> <tibble> <tibble> <glm>  <tibble>  <tibble>  \n3         3 <split [123/31]> <tibble> <tibble> <glm>  <tibble>  <tibble>  \n4         4 <split [123/31]> <tibble> <tibble> <glm>  <tibble>  <tibble>  \n# … with 2 more variables: eval_test <list>, eval_train <list>\n\n\nWe can extract the accuracy of predictions on each of the training and test sets as follows:\n\ntest_accuracy <- out %>% \n  select(partition, contains('eval')) %>%\n  unnest(eval_test) %>%\n  select(partition, .metric, .estimate) %>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = .metric, values_from = .estimate)\n\ntrain_accuracy <- out %>% \n  select(partition, contains('eval')) %>%\n  unnest(eval_train) %>%\n  select(partition, .metric, .estimate) %>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = .metric, values_from = .estimate)\n\ntest_accuracy %>% head(4)\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 5\n  partition sensitivity specificity accuracy roc_auc\n      <int>       <dbl>       <dbl>    <dbl>   <dbl>\n1         1       0.6         0.562    0.581   0.675\n2         2       0.778       0.538    0.677   0.645\n3         3       0.684       0.917    0.774   0.846\n4         4       0.684       0.833    0.742   0.842\n\ntrain_accuracy %>% head(4)\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 5\n  partition sensitivity specificity accuracy roc_auc\n      <int>       <dbl>       <dbl>    <dbl>   <dbl>\n1         1       0.803       0.806    0.805   0.858\n2         2       0.741       0.831    0.789   0.858\n3         3       0.737       0.742    0.740   0.825\n4         4       0.719       0.773    0.748   0.825\n\n\nLastly, we can average the metrics over all partitions and also check the variability across partitions. We’ll start with the training set:\n\ntrain_summaries <- train_accuracy %>%\n  rename(roc.auc = roc_auc) %>%\n  select(-partition) %>%\n  summarize_all(.funs = list(mean = mean, sd = sd)) %>%\n  gather() %>%\n  separate(key, into = c('metric', 'stat'), sep = '_') %>%\n  spread(stat, value)\n\nNow compute the average and variability on the test set:\n\ntest_summaries <- test_accuracy %>%\n  rename(roc.auc = roc_auc) %>%\n  select(-partition) %>%\n  summarize_all(.funs = list(mean = mean, sd = sd)) %>%\n  gather() %>%\n  separate(key, into = c('metric', 'stat'), sep = '_') %>%\n  spread(stat, value)\n\nNow let’s put them side-by-side:\n\nleft_join(train_summaries, \n          test_summaries,\n          by = 'metric',\n          suffix = c('.train', '.test')) %>%\n  select(metric, contains('mean'), contains('sd')) %>%\n  knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\nmetric\nmean.train\nmean.test\nsd.train\nsd.test\n\n\n\n\naccuracy\n0.7573374\n0.7225806\n0.0207045\n0.0702816\n\n\nroc.auc\n0.8348238\n0.7994956\n0.0158188\n0.0706822\n\n\nsensitivity\n0.7565383\n0.7093282\n0.0308425\n0.1073645\n\n\nspecificity\n0.7569019\n0.7416470\n0.0282898\n0.1148716\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that:\n\nThe apparent accuracy according to all metrics is higher on average on the training data across partitionings\nThe accuracy metrics on the test data are more variable across partitionings\n\nThis behavior is the justification for data partitioning: evaluating predictions on the same data that was used to fit the model overestimates the accuracy compared with data that was not used in fitting."

afternoon.According to Captain Scott Adams with the Blytheville Police Department, Hartzell Watson, 44, was arrested after being forced out of a home in the 500-block of North Division.Captain Adams said police originally responded to the house after a family dispute.When officers arrived, Watson barricaded himself in the house and refused to exit peacefully.After several hours, police fired smoke and a chemical agent through a window of the home. The gas caught on fire within minutes.Officers entered the burning house to find Watson, but he jumped out of an attic window.He was checked by paramedics on the scene and was taken into custody.The Blytheville Fire Department was on scene and quickly put the fire out.Watson was then taken to the Mississippi County Jail. He is being held on state and federal warrants.The Arkansas State Police, Mississippi County Sheriff&#039;s Office, and the Second Judicial Drug Task Force assisted with the standoff.One officer on the scene was treated for dehydration.Copyright 2016 KAIT.

Captain Adams said police originally responded to the house after a family dispute. When officers arrived, Watson barricaded himself in the house and refused to exit peacefully. After several hours, police fired smoke and a chemical agent through a window of the home. The gas caught on fire within minutes. Officers entered the burning house to find Watson, but he jumped out of an attic window. He was checked by paramedics on the scene and was taken into custody. The Blytheville Fire Department was on scene and quickly put the fire out. Watson was then taken to the Mississippi County Jail. He is being held on state and federal warrants. The Arkansas State Police, Mississippi County Sheriff's Office, and the Second Judicial Drug Task Force assisted with the standoff. One officer on the scene was treated for dehydration.

and getting her job back looks unlikely the case began when the elderly neighbor s daughter came for an extended visit and discovered that her mother was not getting any mail investigators said the daughter discovered that lay had arranged for the mail to be held at the post office presumably so that the daughter would not see any of the bank statements or other financial documents once the daughter collected the mail and financial information she called the alachua county sheriff s office to report money was missing from the woman s bank account sgt tom wetherington determined that more than two dozen checks worth more than had been fraudulently written on the woman s account wetherington noted that most of the money was taken from the account in checks made out to lay or feindt the rest of the money was taken from the account by writing checks to others who apparently were unaware they may have been written fraudulently during the investigation which ultimately cleared feindt

A quick visual scan of the text file will confirm that each book is set off by the title on one line followed by ‘By Dr. Seuss’ on the next line.\nWe can leverage this structure to distinguish the books: the chunk below\n\ncreates a ‘flag’ by pattern-matching each line with Dr. Seuss,\nthen shifts the lines down by one so that the flag matches the title line instead of the author line\nthen assigns a document ID to each line by computing the total number of flags in all preceding lines.\n\nThe last two commands correct for having ‘lagged’ the lines.\n\n# flag lines with a document id\nseuss_lines_df <- tibble(line_lag = c(seuss_lines, NA)) %>%\n  mutate(flag = str_detect(line_lag, 'Dr. Seuss'),\n         line = lag(line_lag, n = 1),\n         doc = cumsum(flag)) %>% \n  select(doc, line) %>%\n  slice(-1) %>%\n  fill(doc)\n\nWe may as well assign labels to the document IDs.\n\n# grab titles\ntitles <- seuss_lines_df %>% \n  group_by(doc) %>%\n  slice_head() %>%\n  pull(line) %>%\n  tolower()\n\n# label docs\nseuss_lines_df <- seuss_lines_df %>%\n  mutate(doc = factor(doc, labels = titles))\n\nFinally, we’ll strip the title and author information, because all books are by the same author and the title is now recorded in the document ID.\nThe chunk below adds a document-specific line number and removes the first two lines from every document. Since each row is a line, this amounts to a simple row numbering and filtering.\n\n# remove header lines (title/author)\nseuss_lines_clean <- seuss_lines_df %>%\n  group_by(doc) %>%\n  mutate(line_num = row_number() - 2) %>%\n  filter(line_num > 0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\nLine summaries\nSee if you can answer the following questions:\n\nHow many lines are in each book?\nHow many lines in each book contain the word ‘bump’?\n\nWork with a neighbor. Hint: you might find it handy to use str_detect() , and grouped operations and/or summaries.\n\n\n\n\nCollapsing lines and cleaning text\nFirst, concatenate all the lines using str_c() .\n\n# collapse lines into one long string\nseuss_text <- seuss_lines_clean %>% \n  summarize(text = str_c(line, collapse = ' '))\n\nIn this case the resulting text strings for each document don’t contain too many elements in need of removal: just punctuation and capital letters.\n\ncat_in_hat <- seuss_text %>% slice(1) %>% pull(text)\n\nTo strip these elements, we can exclude matching patterns from the collection of punctuation marks and then use tolower() to replace upper-case letters with lower-case letters.

all so all we could do was to sit sit sit sit and we did not like it not one little bit bump and then something went bump how that bump made us jump we looked then we saw him step in on the mat we looked and we saw him the cat in the hat and he said to us why do you sit there like that i know it is wet and the sun is not sunny but we can have lots of good fun that is funny i know some good games we could play said the cat i know some new tricks said the cat in the hat a lot of good tricks i will show them to you your mother will not mind at all if i do then sally and i did not know what to say our mother was out of the house for the day but our fish said no no make that cat go away tell that cat in the hat you do not want to play he should not be here he should not be about he should not be here when your mother is out now now have no fear have no fear said the cat my tricks are not bad said the cat in the hat why we can have lots of good fun if you wish with a game that i call upupup with a fish put me down said the fish this is no fun at all put me down said the fish i do not wish to fall have no fear said the cat i will not let you fall i will hold you up high as i stand on a ball with a book on one hand and a cup on my hat but that is not all i can do said the cat look at me look at me now said the cat with a cup and a cake on the top of my hat i can hold up two books i can hold up the fish and a litte toy ship and some milk on a dish and look i can hop up and down on the ball but that is not all oh no that is not all look at me look at me look at me now it is fun to have fun but you have to know how i can hold up the cup and the milk and the cake i can hold up these books and the fish on a rake i can hold the toy ship and a little toy man and look with my tail i can hold a red fan i can fan with the fan as i hop on the ball but that is not all oh no that is not all that is what the cat said then he fell on his head he came down with a bump from up there on the ball and sally and i we saw all the things fall and our fish came down too he fell into a pot he said do i like this oh no i do not this is not a good game said our fish as he lit no i do not like it not one little bit now look what you did said the fish to the cat now look at this house look at this look at that you sank our toy ship sank it deep in the cake you shook up our house and you bent our new rake you should not be here when our mother is not you get out of this house said the fish in the pot but i like to be here oh i like it a lot said the cat in the hat to the fish in the pot i will not go away i do not wish to go and so said the cat in the hat so so so i will show you another good game that i know and then he ran out and then fast as a fox the cat in the hat came back in with a box a big red wood box it was shut with a hook now look at this trick said the cat take a look then he got up on top with a tip of his hat i call this game funinabox said the cat in this box are two things i will show to you now you will like these two things said the cat with a bow i will pick up the hook you will see something new two things and i call them thing one and thing two these things will not bite you they want to have fun then out of the box came thing two and thing one and they ran to us fast they said how do you do would you like to shake hands with thing one and thing two and sally and i did not know what to do so we had to shake hands with thing one and thing two we shook their two hands but our fish said no no those things should not be in this house make them go they should not be here when your mother is not put them out put them out said the fish in the pot have no fear little fish said the cat in the hat these things are good things and he gave them a pat they are tame oh so tame they have come here to play they will give you some fun on this wet wet wet day now here is a game that they like said the cat they like to fly kites said the cat in the hat no not in the house said the fish in the pot they should not fly kites in a house they should not oh the things they will bump oh the things they will hit oh i do not like it not one little bit then sally and i saw them run down the hall we saw those two things bump their kites on the wall bump thump thump bump down the wall in the hall thing two and thing one they ran up they ran down on the string of one kite we saw mothers new gown her gown with the dots that are pink white and red then we saw one kite bump on the head of her bed then those things ran about with big bumps jumps and kicks and with hops and big thumps and all kinds of bad tricks and i said i do not like the way that they play if mother could see this oh what would she say then our fish said look look and our fish shook with fear your mother is on her way home do you hear oh what will she do to us what will she say oh she will not like it to find us this way so do something fast said the fish do you hear i saw her your mother your mother is near so as fast as you can think of something to do you will have to get rid of thing one and thing two so as fast as i could i went after my net and i said with my net i can get them i bet i bet with my net i can get those things yet then i let down my net it came down with a plop and i had them at last thoe two things had to stop then i said to the cat now you do as i say you pack up those things and you take them away oh dear said the cat you did not like our game oh dear what a shame what a shame what a shame then he shut up the things in the box with the hook and the cat went away with a sad kind of look that is good said the fish he has gone away yes but your mother will come she will find this big mess and this mess is so big and so deep and so tall we ca not pick it up there is no way at all and then who was back in the house why the cat have no fear of this mess said the cat in the hat i always pick up all my playthings and so i will show you another good trick that i know then we saw him pick up all the things that were down he picked up the cake and the rake and the gown and the milk and the strings and the books and the dish and the fan and the cup and the ship and the fish and he put them away then he said that is that and then he was gone with a tip of his hat then our mother came in and she said to us two did you have any fun tell me what did you do and sally and i did not know what to say should we tell her the things that went on there that day should we tell her about it now what should we do well what would you do if your mother asked you\"\n\n\nTo apply this to all four texts, simply create a function wrapper for the processing commands and then use dplyr to pass the text through the processing

Use the code chunk below to partition the data. Do not change the RNG seed or split proportion!\n\n# partition data\nset.seed(102722)\npartitions <- claims %>% initial_split(prop = 0.8)\n\n# separate DTM from labels\ntest_dtm <- testing(partitions) %>%\n  select(-.id, -bclass, -mclass)\ntest_labels <- testing(partitions) %>%\n  select(.id, bclass, mclass)\n\n# same, training set\ntrain_dtm <- training(partitions) %>%\n  select(-.id, -bclass, -mclass)\ntrain_labels <- training(partitions) %>%\n  select(.id, bclass, mclass)\n\nNote that we have separated the document term matrix (DTM) from the labels for both partitions. When we project the data onto a subspace, we only want to project the DTM and not the labels.\n\n\nStep 2: projection\nNow find the number of principal components that capture at least 70% of variation and project the document term matrix (DTM) onto those components. Use the custom function projection_fn(.dtm, .prop) .\n\n# find projections based on training data\nproj_out <- projection_fn(.dtm = train_dtm, .prop = 0.7)\ntrain_dtm_projected <- proj_out$data\n\n# how many components were used?\nproj_out$n_pc\n\nNote: projections were found using the training data only. The test data will ultimately be projected onto the same components, as if it were new information we were feeding into a predictive model developed entirely using the training data.\n\n\nStep 3: regression\nBind the binary labels to the projected document term matrix and fit a logistic regression model.\nThe code chunk below gives you the input data frame you need to use glm(). It’s up to you to specify the other arguments needed to fit the model.\n\ntrain <- train_labels %>%\n  transmute(bclass = factor(bclass)) %>%\n  bind_cols(train_dtm_projected)\n\nfit <- glm(..., data = train, ...)\n\nYou will most likely get a warning of some kind – that’s expected. Take note of what the warning says and stop here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nBriefly discuss with your table: what do you think the warning means?"

In the function call, a predictor matrix and response vector are used to specify the model instead of a formula.\nUse the code chunk below to fit the model for a path of regularization strengths, select a strength, and extract the fitted model corresponding to that strength. Do not adjust the RNG seed.\n\n# store predictors and response as matrix and vector\nx_train <- train %>% select(-bclass) %>% as.matrix()\ny_train <- train_labels %>% pull(bclass)\n\n# fit enet model\nalpha_enet <- 0.3\nfit_reg <- glmnet(x = x_train, \n                  y = y_train, \n                  family = 'binomial',\n                  alpha = alpha_enet)\n\n# choose a strength by cross-validation\nset.seed(102722)\ncvout <- cv.glmnet(x = x_train, \n                y = y_train, \n                family = 'binomial',\n                alpha = alpha_enet)\n\n# store optimal strength\nlambda_opt <- cvout$lambda.min\n\n# view results\ncvout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nComment. The elastic net parameter alpha controls the balance between ridge and LASSO penalties: alpha = 0 corresponds to ridge regression, alpha = 1 corresponds to LASSO, and all other values specify a mixture. When the parameter is closer to 1, the LASSO penalty is stronger relative to ridge; and vice-versa when it’s closer to 0.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: prediction\nTo compute predictions, we’ll need to project the test data onto the same directions used to transform the training data.\nOnce that’s done, we can simply feed the projected test data, the fitted model fit_reg, and the optimal strength lambda_opt to a predict() call.\n\n# project test data onto PCs\ntest_dtm_projected <- reproject_fn(.dtm = test_dtm, proj_out)\n\n# coerce to matrix\nx_test <- as.matrix(test_dtm_projected)\n\n# compute predicted probabilities\npreds <- predict(fit_reg, \n                 s = lambda_opt, \n                 newx = x_test,\n                 type = 'response')\n\nNext bind the test labels to the predictions:\n\n# store predictions in a data frame with true labels\npred_df <- test_labels %>%\n  transmute(bclass = factor(bclass)) %>%\n  bind_cols(pred = as.numeric(preds)) %>%\n  mutate(bclass.pred = factor(pred > 0.5, \n                              labels = levels(bclass)))\n\n# define classification metric panel \npanel <- metric_set(sensitivity, \n                    specificity, \n                    accuracy, \n                    roc_auc)\n\n# compute test set accuracy\npred_df %>% panel(truth = bclass, \n                  estimate = bclass.pred, \n                  pred, \n                  event_level = 'second')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nBriefly discuss with your table:\n\nHow satisfied are you with the predictive performance?\nDoes the classifier do a better job picking out relevant pages or irrelevant pages?"
