Students are responsible for material discussed in their absence and should review posted session notes and consult a classmate.\nDeadlines. Students are expected to meet assignment deadlines in a timely manner. All deadlines have a 24-hour grace period. Late or amended work may not be accepted.\nEmail. Course staff will make their best effort to reply to email within 48 weekday hours. However, due to high volume, staff cannot guarantee that all messages will receive replies.\nIllness. Students who are ill are required to stay home. Students ill with COVID-19 must comply with university policy regarding reporting and quarantine. Accommodations will be made to ensure that students absent due to illness do not fall behind.\nAccommodations. Reasonable accommodations will be made for any student with a qualifying disability. Such requests should be made through the Disabled Students Program (DSP). More information, instructions on how to access accommodations, and information on related resources can be found on the DSP website. Note: in this class there are no timed assessments.\nLetter grades. Letter grades are assigned based only on the assessments identified above and according to university guidelines, with the relative weighting of assessments determined at the discretion of the instructor. While grade calculations will not be disclosed, students are entitled to an explanation of the criteria used to determine their grades if desired. Grades will not be changed except in the case of clerical errors. If students feel their grade has been unfairly assigned, they are entitled to contest it following UCSB procedure for contesting grades.\nConduct. All course participants are expected to maintain respectful and honorable conduct consistent with UCSB ethical standards. Students uncomfortable with the behavior of another course participant for any reason should notify the instructor, course staff, or, if the complaint relates to course staff conduct, an administrative or departmental officer. Evidence of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct (OSC); evidence of problematic behavior will be addressed on a case-by-case basis in accord with university policies."

The most basic sequence that accomplishes the above steps is:\n\ngit pull update the local repository (technically, fetch changes + merge changes from the remote repository);\ngit add stage file changes to be committed to the local repository;\ngit commit commit staged changes to the local repository;\ngit push send committed changes back to the remote repository.\n\nSometimes contributors take different or additional actions; the complexity of the Git actions required to make a change depends largely on repository settings, permissions, and agreements among collaborators about how workflow should be structured."

    "text": "Basic Git actions\nHere you’ll make a local change and then push that change to the remote repository.\n\nPull\nThe first step to making a change is ensuring you have the most up-to-date version of the repository files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction (individual)\n\n\n\nPull changes from the remote repository.\n\nIn your GitHub client, open the group sandbox repository and then look for a ‘Pull’ menu item.\nIf you are using GitHub desktop, you can alternatively ‘fetch origin’ first via a toolbar button. This will retrieve changes but without modifying local files, and if changes are detected, a button will appear in the main screen of the client to pull changes.\nIn the terminal: navigate to the root directory of the repository and git pull\n\n\n\nNow check the repository history to see what changes you just pulled. In GitHub Desktop, there is a history tab on the left-hand side that lists commits chronologically. Select a commit to view line-by-line differences for every file that was altered.\nYou should see two changes: that there is now a class-activity folder containing a copy of this activity; and the README file has been updated. Look at the differences on the readme file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemark\n\n\n\nFetching vs. pulling\nFetching allows you to retrieve changes from the remote repository without merging them into your local repository. If there are commits that you haven’t merged, you can examine them before doing so in one of two ways:\n\nin the terminal, git diff main origin/main\nopen the remote repository on github.com and check the commit history (look for a clock icon with the number of commits in the upper right corner of the file navigator in the code menu); open any commit to see a line-by-line comparison of differences.\n\n\n\n\n\nMake changes\nNow that you have the most up-to-date version of all files, create a new markdown file in the class activity folder with a fun fact about you (or anything else if you’d rather) that you’ll upload to the repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction (individual)\n\n\n\nCreate a markdown file:\n\nIn RStudio, select File > New File > Markdown File\nAdd an ‘About Me’ or similar header (use one or more hashes # before the header text)\nWrite a fun fact about yourself\nSave the file as YOURGITHUBUSERNAME-about.md in the class activity folder\n\n\n\n\n\nStage and commit changes\nNow that your new file is ready to go you can stage the changes to be committed to the repository and create a commit.\nA commit is a bundle of changes that will be submitted to the repository along with a message briefly explaining the changes made. Your GitHub client will often fill in a default message such as ‘update FILENAME.EXT’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction (individual)\n\n\n\nStage and commit:\n\nIn your client, look for a menu item to add or stage changes. By default any changes made to any file will be included. In GitHub Desktop, look for the ‘Changes’ menu next to ‘History’; you can stage changes by simply selecting or unselecting the checkbox next to each file that was altered.\n\nOr in the terminal: git add FILENAME\n\nOnce you have staged changes, look for a menu item to commit changes. Add a message and commit the changes. In GitHub Desktop, this appears at the bottom of the ‘Changes’ menu.\n\nOr in the terminal: git add -m \"your message here\"\n\n\n\n\nOften these actions are performed together. However, in some workflows it may make sense to stage changes incrementally and create commits that bundle several changes at once. For example, if you need to make an update that requires modifying files A, B, and C, it may make sense to edit and stage changes to A first, followed by B, followed by C, and create the commit only once the full update has been implemented.\n\n\nPush\nThe last step is to push your commit to the remote repository. However, as you will see in a moment, too many people trying to push changes at once can create some problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction (group)\n\n\n\n\nChoose one person at your table to push their changes. The very first person to do this will have no problems, since their local repository is up to date with the remote.\nThen choose someone else to try – use the main screen at your workstation if possible so everyone at the table can see. Since the first person modified the remote repository, the next person to push changes will no longer be up to date. Git will detect this and the push won’t go through.\nHave the second person update their local repository by pulling changes, and then try the push again. It should go through once their local is up to date with the remote.\nHave everyone at your table pull changes but do not push any additional commits.\n\n\n\nSo far everyone is working on independent files and there’s no overlap between changes, so although it would be a bit of a hassle to have everyone check for changes every time they push, in principle it could be done. However, there is a more efficient way to work in parallel: by creating branches."

It should consist of a single example-project.Rproj file.\n\n\nAdd content\nWe may as well populate the project with a few files – so let’s add a dataset and write a short script, as if we’re just starting a data analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\nRetrieve data and store a local copy\n\nOpen a new script: File > New File > R Script\nIn the navigator, create a folder called data and a folder called scripts\nCopy and paste the code chunk below into your script.\nExecute once, then save in the scripts folder as data-retrieval.R and close\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# retrieve pollution data\nurl <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pstat197/pstat197a/main/materials/labs/lab1-setup/data/pollution.csv'\npollution <- read_csv(url)\n\n# write as csv to file\nwrite_csv(pollution, file = 'data/pollution.csv')\n\n# clear environment\nrm(list = ls())\n\n\nNext, we’ll do a simple regression analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\nCreate a script\n\nCreate a new script as before\nCopy-paste the code chunk below into your script\nExecute once and examine the results\nSave in the scripts folder as slr-analysis.R\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# load data\npollution <- read_csv('data/pollution.csv')\n\n# examine scatterplot with SLR fit\nggplot(pollution,\n       aes(x = log(SO2), y = Mort)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')\n\n\n\n# compute SLR fit\nfit <- lm(Mort ~ log(SO2), data = pollution)\nbroom::tidy(fit)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n  <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>\n1 (Intercept)    887.      17.6      50.4  1.37e-49\n2 log(SO2)        16.7      4.99      3.35 1.40e- 3\n\n# interpret\nfit_ci <- confint(fit, parm = 'log(SO2)')*log(1.2)\n\npaste('With 95% confidence, every 20% increase in sulfur dioxide pollution is associated with an increase in two-year mortality rate between', \n      round(fit_ci[1], 2), \n      'and', \n      round(fit_ci[2], 2), \n      'per 100k', sep = ' ') %>% \n  print()\n\n[1] \"With 95% confidence, every 20% increase in sulfur dioxide pollution is associated with an increase in two-year mortality rate between 1.23 and 4.87 per 100k\"\n\n\n\nCongrats on your first project! You can close the RStudio session now.\nWe’ll be using projects structured much like what you just set up, but with one catch: we’ll link up our RStudio projects with shared repositories so that we can all collaborate on the same set of project files."

    "text": "GitHub repositories\n\nWe will be distributing course assignments as repositories via GitHub Classroom. A repository is simply a storage space.\nHere we’ll walk you through how to access and copy the files in a repository just as you will for course assignments. The first step is to accept an assignment through a link we’ve given to you – this will create a repository for you with the files we intend for you to have.\nFor now, we’ll make a ‘group sandbox’ that you can play in during our next class meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\nAccept an assignment in GitHub Classroom\n\nFollow the link to accept the group-sandbox assignment. Since it’s a group assignment, you will be prompted to join a team.\nJoin the team for the table you sat at during last class meeting. If you don’t remember, check your attendance form receipt.\n\nYou should be directed to a team repository on github.com. You may need to refresh your browser. Keep this window open; you will need the URL.\n\n\n\nGit and GitHub\nAt some point in time – possibly quite recently – you had to install Git on your local machine, as well as create a GitHub account. So, Git and GitHub are two different things.\nGit is version control software that enables you to systematically track and control file changes within a repository – a collection of files possibly with some directory structure. (The definition of ‘repository’ is simply ‘storage place’.)\nGitHub is an online platform for hosting repositories remotely. Anyone with access to a repository can make changes to files in the repository, and this enables multiple people to collaborate on code.\n\n\nlocal <> remote\nUsually remote repositories are not updated directly because contributors need to execute codes to test their changes and the remote server that hosts the repository is not equipped to do this.\nInstead, contributors will prepare changes on their own machine where they can test them, and then update the remote repository once their changes are complete.\nThis process of implementing file changes in a repository involves communicating information between local and remote locations. For this purpose a local copy of the remote repository is needed.\n\n\nCloning a repository\nIn Git lingo, a clone is a local copy of a remote repository. Creating a clone copies files and establishes the link between local and remote repositories so that changes can be sent to and received from the remote repository. You only need to create a clone once.\nTo clone a repository, all one needs is:\n\nthe remote location URL;\nthe local destination where the clone will be created;\npermission from the repository owner, if private.\n\nHere you’ll clone the group sandbox repository you just created/joined. You will need the URL; if you happened to close the page when you accepted the assignment earlier, you should be able to find the repository from your home page on github.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\nClone the sandbox repository:\n\nOpen your GitHub client (GitKracken or GitHub Desktop or similar) and ensure you are logged in to your GitHub account.\nLook for a ‘Clone Repo’ menu item or similar and simply input the URL and the place you’d like to clone it; proceed through any prompts.\nCheck your file navigator to confirm that the repository files were copied.\n\n\n\n\nAn alternative possibility is to create the clone using a terminal command. In the terminal, navigate to the desired destination, and input:\ngit clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPONAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemarks\n\n\n\nOn terminal commands:\n\nIt’s recommended to manage Git actions through a visual client, as it’s much easier to see and understand what’s happening.\nHowever, if you know exactly what you’re doing, executing simple actions via Git bash in the terminal can be more efficient at times.\nFor example, you can keep a terminal open in RStudio and manage your repository workflow from there, without having to toggle between environments.\nTry experimenting with terminal commands from RStudio after you have a little experience with basic Git actions."

    "section": "Data types",
    "text": "Data types\nThere are five main data types in R.\nNumeric (double- or single-precision floating point) data represent real numbers. Numeric data are abbreviated num and by default are stored as double-precision floating point.\n\n# a number\n4.5\n\n[1] 4.5\n\n# check structure\nstr(4.5)\n\n num 4.5\n\n# stored as double\nis.double(4.5)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nInteger data are integers. For the most part they behave like numeric data, except occupy less memory, which can in some cases be convenient. To distinguish integers from doubles, R uses a trailing L after values; the data type is abbreviated int.\n\n# an integer\n4L\n\n[1] 4\n\n# check structure\nstr(4L)\n\n int 4\n\n\nLogical data are binary and represented in R as having values TRUE and FALSE. They are abbreviated logi in R. Often they are automatically coerced to integer data with values 0 (false) and 1 (true) to perform arithmetic and other operations.\n\n# logical value\nTRUE\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n# check structure\nstr(TRUE)\n\n logi TRUE\n\n# arithmetic\nTRUE + FALSE\n\n[1] 1\n\n# check structure\nstr(FALSE + FALSE)\n\n int 0\n\n\nCharacter data represent strings of text and are sometimes called ‘strings’. They are abbreviated chr in R and values are surrounded by quotation marks; this distinguishes, for example, the character 4 from the number 4. Single quotations can be used to input strings as well as double quotations. Arithmetic is not possible with strings for obvious reasons.\n\n# a character string\n'yay'\n\n[1] \"yay\"\n\n# check structure\nstr('yay')\n\n chr \"yay\"\n\n# string arithmetic won't work\n'4' + '1'\n\nError in \"4\" + \"1\": non-numeric argument to binary operator\n\n# but can be performed after coercing character to string\nas.numeric('4') + as.numeric('1')\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nFactor data represent categorical variables. In R these are encoded numerically according to the number of ‘levels’ of the factor, which represent the unique values of the categorical variable, and each level is labeled. R will print the labels, not the levels, of factors; the data type is abbreviated fct.\n\n# a factor\nfactor(1, levels = c(1, 2), labels = c('blue', 'red'))\n\n[1] blue\nLevels: blue red\n\n# less verbose definition\nfactor('blue', levels = c('blue', 'red'))\n\n[1] blue\nLevels: blue red\n\n# check structure\nstr(factor('blue', levels = c('blue', 'red')))\n\n Factor w/ 2 levels \"blue\",\"red\": 1\n\n\nUsually factors won’t be defined explicitly, but instead interpreted from character data. The levels and labels of factors can be manipulated using a variety of helper functions."

    "title": "Tidyverse basics",
    "section": "Object classes",
    "text": "Object classes\nThe most basic type of object in R is a vector. Vectors are concatenations of data values of the same type. They are defined using the concatenation operator c() and are indexed by consecutive integers; subvectors can be retrieved by specifying the indices between square brackets.\n\n# numeric vector\nc(1, 4, 7)\n\n[1] 1 4 7\n\n# character vector\nc('blue', 'red')\n\n[1] \"blue\" \"red\" \n\n# indexing\nc(1, 4, 7)[1]\n\n[1] 1\n\nc(1, 4, 7)[2]\n\n[1] 4\n\nc(1, 4, 7)[3]\n\n[1] 7\n\nc(1, 4, 7)[2:3]\n\n[1] 4 7\n\nc(1, 4, 7)[c(1, 3)]\n\n[1] 1 7\n\n\nUsually objects are assigned names for easy retrieval. Vectors will not show any special object class if the structure is examined; str() will simply return the data type, index range, and the values.\n\n# assign a name\nmy_vec <- c(1, 4, 7)\n\n# check structure\nstr(my_vec)\n\n num [1:3] 1 4 7\n\n\nNext up in complexity are arrays. These are blocks of data values of the same type indexed along two or more dimensions. For arrays, str() will return the data type, index structure, and data values; when printed directly, data values are arranged according to the indexing.\n\n# an array\nmy_ary <- array(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), \n           dim = c(2, 4))\n\nmy_ary\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]\n[1,]    1    3    5    7\n[2,]    2    4    6    8\n\nstr(my_ary)\n\n num [1:2, 1:4] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\n# another array\nmy_oth_ary <- array(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), \n           dim = c(2, 2, 2))\n\nmy_oth_ary\n\n, , 1\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    3\n[2,]    2    4\n\n, , 2\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    5    7\n[2,]    6    8\n\nstr(my_oth_ary)\n\n num [1:2, 1:2, 1:2] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\n\nFor arrays, elements can be retrieved by index coordinates, and slices can be retrieved by leaving index positions blank, which will return all elements along the corresponding indices.\n\n# one element\nmy_ary[1, 2]\n\n[1] 3\n\n# one element\nmy_oth_ary[1, 2, 1]\n\n[1] 3\n\n# a slice (second row)\nmy_ary[2, ]\n\n[1] 2 4 6 8\n\n# a slice (first layer)\nmy_oth_ary[ , , 1]\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    3\n[2,]    2    4\n\n\nNext there are lists, which are perhaps the most flexible data structure. A list is an indexed collection of any objects.\n\n# a list\nlist('cat', c(1, 4, 7), TRUE)\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"cat\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 1 4 7\n\n[[3]]\n[1] TRUE\n\n# a named list\nlist(animal = 'cat',\n     numbers = c(1, 4, 7),\n     short = TRUE)\n\n$animal\n[1] \"cat\"\n\n$numbers\n[1] 1 4 7\n\n$short\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nList elements can be retrieved by index in double square brackets, or by name.\n\n# assign a name\nmy_lst <- list(animal = 'cat',\n               numbers = c(1, 4, 7),\n               short = TRUE)\n\n# check structure\nstr(my_lst)\n\nList of 3\n $ animal : chr \"cat\"\n $ numbers: num [1:3] 1 4 7\n $ short  : logi TRUE\n\n# retrieve an element\nmy_lst[[1]]\n\n[1] \"cat\"\n\n# equivalent\nmy_lst$animal\n\n[1] \"cat\"\n\n\nFinally, data frames are type-heterogeneous lists of vectors of equal length. More informally, they are 2D arrays with columns of differing data types. str() will essentially show the list structure; but when printed, data frames will appear arranged in a table.\n\n# a data frame\nmy_df <- data.frame(animal = c('cat', 'hare', 'tortoise'),\n                    has.fur = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE),\n                    weight.lbs = c(9.1, 8.2, 22.7))\n\nstr(my_df)\n\n'data.frame':   3 obs. of  3 variables:\n $ animal    : chr  \"cat\" \"hare\" \"tortoise\"\n $ has.fur   : logi  TRUE TRUE FALSE\n $ weight.lbs: num  9.1 8.2 22.7\n\nmy_df\n\n    animal has.fur weight.lbs\n1      cat    TRUE        9.1\n2     hare    TRUE        8.2\n3 tortoise   FALSE       22.7\n\n\nThe data frame is the standard object type for representing datasets in R. For the most part, modern computing in R is designed around the data frame."

suggest any patterns?\n\n\n\n\n\nSummaries\nSummaries are easily computed across rows using summarize() . So if for example we want to use the filtering and selection from before to find the proportion of advanced students in statistics with research experience, use:\n\n# a summary\nbackground %>%\n  filter(stat.prof == 'Adv') %>%\n  mutate(avg.comf = (math.comf + prog.comf + stat.comf)/3) %>%\n  select(avg.comf, rsrch) %>%\n  summarize(prop.rsrch = mean(rsrch))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  prop.rsrch\n       <dbl>\n1      0.611\n\n# equivalent\nbackground %>%\n  filter(stat.prof == 'Adv') %>%\n  mutate(avg.comf = (math.comf + prog.comf + stat.comf)/3) %>%\n  select(avg.comf, rsrch) %>%\n  pull(rsrch) %>%\n  mean()\n\n[1] 0.6111111\n\n\nThe advantage of summarize , however, is that multiple summaries can be computed at once:\n\nbackground %>%\n  filter(stat.prof == 'Adv') %>%\n  mutate(avg.comf = (math.comf + prog.comf + stat.comf)/3) %>%\n  select(avg.comf, rsrch) %>%\n  summarize(prop.rsrch = mean(rsrch),\n            med.comf = median(avg.comf))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  prop.rsrch med.comf\n       <dbl>    <dbl>\n1      0.611        4\n\n\nThe variant summarize_all computes the same summary across all columns. (Notice the use of the helper verb contains() to select all columns containing a particular string.)\n\n# average comfort levels across all students\nbackground %>%\n  select(contains('comf')) %>%\n  summarise_all(.funs = mean)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  prog.comf math.comf stat.comf\n      <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>\n1      3.97      3.85      4.08\n\n\nGrouped summaries are summaries computed separately among subsets of observations. To define a grouping structure using an existing column, use group_by() . Notice the ‘groups’ attribute printed with the output.\n\n# create a grouping\nbackground %>%\n  group_by(stat.prof)\n\n# A tibble: 59 × 30\n# Groups:   stat.prof [3]\n   response.id prog.prof prog.comf math.prof math.comf stat.prof stat.comf\n         <dbl> <chr>         <dbl> <chr>         <dbl> <chr>         <dbl>\n 1           1 Adv               5 Int               3 Adv               4\n 2           2 Int               5 Int               3 Int               4\n 3           3 Int               3 Int               3 Int               4\n 4           4 Int               3 Int               3 Int               3\n 5           5 Int               3 Adv               4 Int               3\n 6           7 Int               3 Adv               4 Int               3\n 7           8 Adv               4 Adv               5 Adv               4\n 8           9 Int               3 Int               3 Int               3\n 9          10 Int               4 Int               3 Adv               4\n10          12 Int               5 Int               4 Int               4\n# … with 49 more rows, and 23 more variables: updv.num <chr>, dom <chr>,\n#   consent <chr>, PSTAT100 <chr>, `PSTAT120A-B` <chr>, PSTAT126 <chr>,\n#   PSTAT127 <chr>, PSTAT134 <chr>, CS9 <chr>, PSTAT131 <chr>, PSTAT174 <chr>,\n#   LING104 <chr>, LING105 <chr>, PSTAT115 <chr>, PSTAT122 <chr>,\n#   `PSTAT160A-B` <chr>, CS16 <chr>, `CS5A-B` <chr>, POLS15 <chr>,\n#   LING110 <chr>, `CS130A-B` <chr>, `CS165A-B` <chr>, rsrch <lgl>\n\n\nSometimes it can be helpful to simply count the observations in each group:\n\n# count observations\nbackground %>%\n  group_by(stat.prof) %>%\n  count()\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n# Groups:   stat.prof [3]\n  stat.prof     n\n  <chr>     <int>\n1 Adv          36\n2 Beg           2\n3 Int          21\n\n\nTo compute a grouped summary, first group the data frame and then specify the summary of interest:\n\n# a grouped summary\nbackground %>%\n  group_by(stat.prof) %>%\n  select(contains('.comf')) %>%\n  summarize_all(.funs = mean)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 4\n  stat.prof prog.comf math.comf stat.comf\n  <chr>         <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>\n1 Adv            4.06      4.14      4.39\n2 Beg            3.5       2.5       2.5 \n3 Int            3.86      3.48      3.71\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\n\nGrouped summaries\n\nCompute the median comfort level of all students in each subject area.\nCompute the median comfort level of all students in each subject area after grouping by number of upper division classes taken.\nCompare and discuss with your neighbor: do you notice any interesting patterns?"
