Computing in PSTAT197A will be shown in R, and codes and other materials will be shared via GitHub. The following software will be required to access course materials:

-   [R](https://www.r-project.org/) version 4.2.0+

-   [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) version 2022.07.1+554

-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) version 2.36.1+

-   A visual GitHub client such as [GitKracken](https://www.gitkraken.com/).

Installations and basic functionality will be covered in the first lab session.

While PSTAT197A is not strictly language-agnostic, it is also not a course especially emphasizing programming techniques in R. Students are therefore free to use other software at their discretion, provided it does not interfere with their participation in the class.
